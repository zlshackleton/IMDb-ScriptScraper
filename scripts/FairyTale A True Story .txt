FADE IN:


EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND - SUMMER (1919) - DAY     2

Under a canopy of mature trees a breeze creates shifting patterns
of dappled sunlight. The O.S. sound of a gurgling stream is music
for a chorus of leaves slow dancing their way down into a musty,
moss-draped glen. Blankets of wild flowers sway in time.

A spindly stream furrows along the bottom of the glen, under an
old fallen tree bridge, then down the rocky terrace of a small
waterfall. Leaves spin in the agitation below. A YOUNG HAND
reaches in and plucks one out.

A thicket of blazing purple heather parts like theater curtains,
revealing a perfectly miniature dining room set -- eight chairs
and a table expertly crafted of tiny twigs and dried flower petals.
The table is elegantly set for tea, with acorn tea cups and
eucalyptus plates.

The young "giant" hand reaches down with the leaf, now a water-
filled urn, and carefully fills each acorn cup with a drop of
water.

Slowly pan up over folds of black material to the pale, too serious
face of ten-year old ELSIE WRIGHT. Her sad eyes desperately search
the glen for her absent "guests".

                          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                     (distant, calling)
                 Elsie!

Elsie looks up, a deer sensing danger.   She quickly closes the
heather and moves off.


EXT.   CARETAKER'S COTTAGE - DAY                                      3
A charming two story thatch roof English cottage set back in a
large clearing off the glen. POLLY WRIGHT, early thirties, dressed
in black, paces the porch, searching for...

                          POLLY
                 Elsie!

Elsie approaches from the glen, sees her mother on the porch,
then sneaks around to the other side of the house.

                           ELSIE
                     (innocent)
                 Yes, Mum?
                                                               2.


Polly turns. Up close we see that her face is drawn. Her sad
eyes register a full tragic compliment -- anguish, remorse,
yearning -- an ugly mask covering an obvious beauty underneath.

                          POLLY
                 Elsie, where have you been?

Elsie points in the opposite direction from which she came.

                          ELSIE
                     (lying)
                 In the garden...

We hear the sound of dogs barking in the distance...


EXT.   WIGGINS MANOR - DAY                                            4

Two classic AIREDALE dogs bark and howl as their master, the stuffy
aristocrat, LORD WIGGINS, keeps them on a short leash. They're
posing for photographs in front of the manor house, a castle-size
brick and ivy fortress, complete with sculptured gardens, classic
statuary, Rolls Royce and endless vistas.

Taking the photographs is ARTIE WRIGHT, amateur photographer and
caretaker to Wiggins Manor. Artie's what they call a real
"Yorkshire man" -- hard working, honest, forthright and genuine.

                          WIGGINS
                 Get on with it, Mr. Wright, I haven't
                 got all day!

Artie fumbles with an old box camera, slides in a glass plate
negative.

                          ARTIE
                 Right, Sir...just one more...that's
                 it...
                     (snaps)
                 Done, Sir.

Wiggins releases the dogs who gallop off past the Rolls Royce.
Wiggins starts off, then turns back. As Artie packs...

                          WIGGINS
                 Make sure my guns are cleaned and
                 oiled for the hunt, Mr. Wright.

                          ARTIE
                 I'll do that, Sir.

Moving past, he taps the Rolls' fairie-like hood ornament.
                                                            3.


                          WIGGINS
                 And give her a look under the hood.
                 She seems a bit winded lately.

                          ARTIE
                 Right, Sir.


INT.   COTTAGE - PARLOR - DAY                                        5

Shards of dusty light slice into the room through half drawn
curtains. The air hangs thick and joyless.

Elsie sits across from her mother, loops of crimson yarn extend
between her small hands. Polly is knitting -- a big, half finished
sweater nestled in her lap.

The spindle of yarn stretches between mother and daughter like an
umbilical cord. They sit in silence. Tears well up in Polly's
eyes. Elsie looks down, as if she were the cause.

The FRONT DOOR creaks open. Elsie turns adoring eyes on her
father, Artie Wright, whose thick, blue collar frame fills the
doorway. He enters carrying his camera equipment. He looks in
on the scene, frowns momentarily, then forces a smile.

                          ELSIE
                     (pleased)
                 Dad...

                           ARTIE
                     (upbeat)
                 Ah, it's good to see m'girls workin'
                 together.

Artie opens a cupboard door under the stairs, puts the camera
equipment inside.
                          POLLY
                 How did it go?

                          ARTIE
                 Well enough, I hope. It's a nice
                 change from cleanin' the kennels.

Artie kisses Elsie on the head. He turns to Polly, thinks twice
and pulls back. He reaches for Elsie's yarn.

                          ARTIE
                     (continuing; to Elsie)
                 C'mon now, give me a chance.

Elsie hesitates, then transfers the yarn to Artie's thick,
calloused hands, allowing her gaze to linger in the blackness of
his fingernails.
                                                               4.


                          ARTIE
                     (continuing, to Elsie)
                 Aren't y'suppose to be playin' or
                 somethin'? Go on.

Elsie smiles and moves off up the stairs.

                          ARTIE
                     (continuing, to Elsie)
                 And don't forget to make up the extra
                 bed. Your cousin'll be in t'morrow.

                          ELSIE
                 I won't forget.

Artie sits across from Polly with the yarn.   It's awkward.

                          ARTIE
                     (after a beat)
                 Did Elsie tell ye?

                          POLLY
                 Tell me what?

                          ARTIE
                 About her exams.   She passed.

                          POLLY
                 Really...I didn't know.

Artie stares at Polly's face for a considerable time.    She doesn't
return his gaze.

                          ARTIE
                     (means it)
                 Damn it, Polly...you're still the
                 prettiest woman in Yorkshire.
A smile tugs at the corner of her mouth.


INT.   COTTAGE - ATTIC BEDROOM - DAY                                   6

Honest and charming, as attic rooms are -- a vaulted ceiling,
exposed beams and rafters, unfinished walls, a wood plank floor,
deep set dormer windows, a small closet. Romantic and tragic at
the same time. The open space is sparsely furnished with two
beds (one unmade,) and a mirrored dresser.

In a corner is a charming, fairy tale doll house, hand crafted of
twigs, moss and dried flower petals. It's very much a work in
progress -- pieces of it remain unfinished.

Flashes of pink color reflect in the beveled edges of the dresser
mirror.
                                                              5.


Then, lightly stepping full figure into the reflection, we see
Elsie, dancing tippy-toe like a ballerina, wearing a shiny pink
dress. Unfastened in back, the dress is loosely draped over her
mourning black. As she reaches out to her reflection...

                         ELSIE
                    (play acting)
                Why, I would love to teach you to
                dance, Princess Mary...

Elsie dizzily waltzes her imaginary partner around and around the
room. A knock at the door shatters her reverie. She scrambles
for cover behind the doll house.

Up over the folds   of the pink dress, across the open back of the
doll house we see   that its tiny rooms are scattered with miniature
twig furniture of   the same design as the pieces in the glen.
There's something   lonely about it all -- a feeling of abandonment.

From outside, giant eyes peer curiously in through the windows.

                         ARTIE
                Fe, fi, fo, fum, I smell the blood
                of an Englishman... Be he alive, or
                be he dead...

Artie rises over the roof of the house like the giant he is.

                         ARTIE
                    (continuing)
                I'll grind his bones to make my bread!

                         ELSIE
                    (can't help but giggle)
                You're a silly one.

                         ARTIE
                How was your mum today?
                            ELSIE
                The same.

Artie notices Elsie's dress.    She becomes self conscious, pulls
it over her head.

                         ARTIE
                That's a pretty dress, Elsie.

Elsie smiles a soft reply.    Artie takes the dress, fingers in its
material.

                         ARTIE
                    (continuing)
                A young girl should wear pretty
                things.
                                                           6.


                          ELSIE
                 I don't mind.

Artie stares at her lovingly for more than a beat.

                          ARTIE
                     (softens)
                 Y've got a good heart, Elsie.
                     (gestures)
                 Give your dad some room.

Elsie scoots over. Artie folds in next to her behind the doll
house. Quiet as he studies its interior, then rearranges some of
the furniture.

                          ARTIE
                     (continuing)
                 Aye, this'll be a fine home someday.

Elsie's thoughts wander the rooms of the doll house.

                          ARTIE
                     (continuing)
                 M'be your cousin Frances could help
                 y'finish it?

                          ELSIE
                 Will she be staying long?

                          ARTIE
                     (heaves a sigh)
                 Unless there's a miracle.


INT.   COTTAGE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                 7

The Wrights are sitting to dinner. Polly and Elsie, both in black,
sit across from each other like stilted ravens. Artie's in the
middle devouring his food. He's talking, perhaps too animated,
for this table. Polly is only half interested, her eyes keep
returning to an empty chair.

                          ARTIE
                     (animated, mid
                      conversation)
                 ...so now the score is tied and the
                 Cottingley boys are charging down
                 with only seconds left.
                     (continuing)
                 Shane Conners passes the ball to
                 Johnny Smythe, the Rector's boy,
                 who's standing square in front of
                 the goal with nothin' but the net in
                 front of him; a gift from God.
                                                               7.


                          ARTIE
                 Little Johnny swings back his leg
                 and kicks with all his soul...

Artie whistles, tracing the trajectory of the ball with his finger.

                          ARTIE
                     (continuing; whistling)
                 ...over the net it went.
                     (good natured laugh)
                 The rector just about broke his beads.

Elsie giggles.   Polly offers a half smile.   Artie catches her
eyes in his.

                          ARTIE
                     (continuing)
                 Y'should've been there, Polly.

                          ARTIE
                 Mrs. Harrison, was askin' about ye.
                 She said they missed y'voice in the
                 choir.
                     (mimicking)
                 "Polly Wright's got a voice like an
                 angel," she said.

Polly's eyes turn to the empty chair.   She's momentarily lost...

                          POLLY
                 Mrs. Harrison was Joseph's art
                 teacher.

Polly looks up, tries to rejoin the conversation...
                          POLLY
                     (continuing, trying)
                 Well, I'm sorry for the lads. Though
                 Joseph would have a thing or two to
                 say to Johnny Smythe, I think.

                          ARTIE
                 Aye, he liked to win, all right.

Polly's eyes cloud over, she pushes back from the table.

                          POLLY
                 Excuse me.

Artie and Elsie watch her hurry off up the stairs.     There's silence
between them.
                                                            8.

                Joseph hated soccer.

                    (agreeing)
                Right. He was a cricket man.

                         ELSIE
                Is she ever going to get better?

                         ARTIE
                'Course she is.

                         ELSIE
                When?

                    (after a beat)
                Y'see, Elsie. It's like your
                brother's death left this big hole
                in her heart.

 Artie grabs a slice of bread, tears a hole out from its middle.

                         ARTIE
                    (continuing)

                do I.

Artie tenderly strokes Elsie's cheek.

                    (continuing)

Elsie gazes up at her father with hopeful eyes.

                         ARTIE
                    (continuing)
                Say, how'd y'like t'come with me to
                Bradford tomorrow to pick up your
                cousin Frances?

Elsie nods enthusiastically, then contemplatively...

                         ELSIE
                I couldn't imagine traveling all the
                way from South Africa by myself.
                She must be terribly frightened.
                                                            9.


EXT.   YORKSHIRE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                  8

The jarring clatter of a powerful steam locomotive bullying it's
way past camera. Fat billows of white smoke trail in its wake.


INT.   TRAIN - OLD PASSENGER CAR - DAY                              9

Rattling and pitching from side to side. The bare bones car is
filled with YOUNG SOLDIERS returning from the "great war." Worn,
maimed and numb, they sit in terrified silence. A silence broken
by the pleading VOICE of a young girl.

                          VOICE (FRANCES) (O.S.)
                     (English accent)
                 Please, Sir?

We move up the aisle in search of the voice, partially revealing
a spasm of wild curls in front of a BANDAGED SOLDIER.

                          VOICE (O.S.)
                     (continuing)
                 Won't you help me?

Swing around to reveal eight year-old FRANCES GRIFFITHS sitting
across from the bandaged soldier. She's holding up a "string
game" webbed between her fingers. Her innocent smile belies the
mischief in her eyes.

                          FRANCES
                 Just put your finger through the
                 middle there...it won't hurt, I
                 promise.

The soldier shifts uncomfortably.    Puts his finger in.

                          FRANCES
                     (continuing, excited)
                 Ready?

Frances suddenly yanks her hands apart and the web disappears,
releasing the soldier's finger. The soldier offers a small smile.
It's all he's got.

Frances' joyous LAUGHTER cuts through the car. SOLDIERS look
back, searching out the unfamiliar sound -- all except one, the
CORPORAL, whom we see from the back only.

                          CORPORAL
                     (growling)
                 Keep it down! This ain't no circus
                 train!
                                                             10.


Reverse angle and we see that the corporal's face is horribly
disfigured --half of it melted like candle wax.

Unawares, Frances slowly walks up the aisle behind him.

                          FRANCES
                Sir...?

Intending to frighten her, the corporal spins around, offering
the full grotesqueness of his disfigurement. Frances doesn't
flinch. She steps up to him proffering her string game.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                Would you like to try?

Disarmed, shamed by his anger.

                         CORPORAL
                My God. What are you doing on this
                train, little girl?

                         FRANCES
                I'm going to visit my uncle in
                Cottingley.

                         CORPORAL
                    (disdainful)
                Holidays...

                         FRANCES
                Oh, no. My daddy's a soldier like
                you. He's stationed in France...
                though they say he's missing.

The corporal knows what "missing" means.   His insides twist.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing; excited)
                But guess what? He promised to bring
                me back French perfume.
                    (matter of fact)
                So I'll be staying in Cottingley
                until he returns. Which shouldn't
                be too long.

The corporal scoots over, gestures for Frances to sit.    She
snuggles in beside him.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing; after a
                     beat)
                I bet you're happy to be going home.
                                                           11.


                          CORPORAL
                     (almost to himself)
                 That's a bet you'd lose.

The corporal tilts away the injured side of his face.

                          FRANCES
                     (after a beat)
                 It doesn't look so bad, really.

                          CORPORAL
                 I look like a monster.

                          FRANCES
                 No you don't. I'm afraid of monsters.
                 I'm not afraid of you.

The corporal's face softens as he stares out the window at the
passing countryside. Frances nudges him. He turns back, she's
holding up the string game.


EXT.   TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY                                  10

Elsie navigates through the crowded platform along side the train,
which shivers and releases its last breath of steam. All around
her, worn and tired SOLDIERS reunite with their FAMILIES. Slowed
by his girth, Artie falls behind.

Elsie stops dead in her tracks. She's looking up at something
with a curious countenance. From her POV up, we see Frances
sitting atop a throne-like luggage cart, playing the string game
with the corporal (his good side to Elsie.) The corporal releases
the web, tangling his hands. They laugh together like old friends.

                          ELSIE
                     (more amazed than unsure)
                 Frances?
                          FRANCES
                     (blaring)
                 Cousin Elsie!

Frances flies off the trunk and nearly bowls Elsie over with a
hug. Elsie's surprised and warmed by the attack. Artie steps
up. Frances hugs him too. The corporal watches the exchange.

                          FRANCES
                     (continuing)
                 Elsie, Uncle Artie, I want you to
                 meet my friend Corporal...

Frances turns back, the corporal is gone.
                                                                 12.


INT.   BRADFORD TRAIN STATION - DAY                                   11

Cavernous, plastered with anti-Kaiser WWI propaganda posters.
Benches are crowded with the silent and weary... "waiting".

Elsie curiously watches Frances shuffle and hop through, as if
mere walking was out of the question. Frances points down to
Elsie's foot.

                          FRANCES
                 Step on a crack, break your mother's
                 back.

Elsie looks down at her foot, directly over a crack.      The
repercussion sinks in. She quickly jumps off.


EXT.   BRADFORD STATION - DAY                                         12

The girls run out onto the street and up to an old horse drawn
lorry -- a low open-back wagon. Frances pats the horse's nose.

                          FRANCES
                 Elsie, your horse is beautiful.

                          ELSIE
                 She's not ours.    She belongs to Lord
                 Wiggins.

                          FRANCES
                 Who's that?

                          ELSIE
                 You ever hear of Wiggins Manor?
                     (Frances shakes her head,
                      "no")
                 Dad's the caretaker.
                          FRANCES
                 Well, it must be a very grand manor
                 if Uncle Artie takes care of it.

                          ELSIE
                 It is the largest in the county.

A HAGGARD-LOOKING MAN wearing a black arm band meanders down the
street passing out flyers. He hands one to Frances as...

Artie arrives and heaves Frances' steamer trunk onto the lorry.

                          ARTIE
                 C'mon girls. It's a long drive back
                 to Cottingley. Up you go.
                                                           13.


Artie lifts Elsie onto the back of the lorry then turns for
Frances, who's already climbing up the spokes of the back wheel.

As the lorry clears out, light reflects off its lantern,
illuminating a face watching from the shadows...it's the corporal.


EXT.   BRADFORD TO COTTINGLEY ROAD - DAY                             13

A vast rolling green carpet dissected by an odd crochet of ancient
stone walls. The lorry moves across a hillside road. Down in
the near distance is quaint Cottingley village.

The girls are huddled over the flyer.

                          FRANCES
                 What's it say, Elsie?

                          ELSIE
                 Something about a lecture.

                          FRANCES
                 What about?

                             ELSIE
                 Angels...

The girls exchange amazed looks, then giggle.

As the lorry approaches.


INT.   COTTAGE - PARLOR - DAY                                        15

Elsie enters followed by Frances.
                          FRANCES
                     (curiously surveying)
                 It's so dark in here.

                          ELSIE
                 We're back, Mum.

Polly is sitting in the parlor with her knitting ready.

                          FRANCES
                 Aunt Polly!

Rushing to Polly, Frances inadvertently drops the flyer on the
floor. She hugs her aunt, who hugs back less intensely.
                                                             14.


                         POLLY
                Frances, let me have a look at you.
                    (arms length)
                What a big girl you are.

                         FRANCES
                    (proudly)
                Almost nine.

Polly strokes Frances' hair.   Elsie watches, a twinge of jealousy
disturbs her.

                         POLLY
                Poor dear girl.    You must have had a
                ghastly trip.

                         FRANCES
                Not at all. On the boat the captain
                let me watch for pirates.

                         POLLY
                How exciting!

Feeling left out, Elsie takes up the yarn, holds it out to her
mother.

                         ELSIE
                    (needy)
                Would you like to knit now, Mum?

Frances feels the sweater.

                         FRANCES
                Oh, it's beautiful.     Who's the lucky
                one?

Polly shifts uncomfortably.    Artie enters and moves quickly, taking
the yarn from Elsie.
                         ARTIE
                    (to Elsie)
                Take Frances up to the room.     She
                must be exhausted.

                         FRANCES
                I'm not really.

Artie shoots her a look which says it isn't an option.

                         ELSIE
                C'mon, Frances.

The girls move off toward the stairs.    Artie tries to comfort
Polly -- it's awkward.
                                                           15.


                          ARTIE
                 Can I get y'anything, Polly?

                          POLLY
                     (shaking her head)
                 No, I'm fine, really.

                     (fumbling)
                 I'll go...get Frances' trunk.

Artie exits. Polly notices the flyer on the floor. She picks it
up, reads: "Do Angels Exist? A Lecture on Theosophy by E.L.
Gardner."


INT.   SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - SAME TIME                             16

Frances rushes up the stairs ahead of Elsie, who's still looking
into the parlor.

                          FRANCES
                 Which room, Elsie?

                     (distracted)
                 Top of the stairs.

On the landing Frances opens the first door she comes to. It's a
young man's room, thick with dust. Cricket sticks hang on the
wall. Books are strewn about in haphazard piles. A tarnished
trumpet sits on a desk. Credible drawings are taped to the walls.

Elsie reaches in past Frances and quickly closes the door. Elsie
points to another set of stairs leading up to an attic room.

                          ELSIE
                     (continuing)

INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - DAY                                          17

Elsie pushes into the room followed by Frances, who's immediately
drawn to the doll house.
                                                            16.

                Oh, Elsie, what a wonderful doll
                house.

Frances looks into the open back.   Examines a twig rocking chair.

                    (continuing)

                         ELSIE
                It's not for dolls, Frances.

Artie kicks open the door and enters lugging Frances' steamer
trunk. He drops it, groans as he comically straightens his back
on his way out. The girls can't help but giggle.

Frances begins unlatching the heavy brass locks of her trunk.
Elsie points back to the high dresser.

                         ELSIE
                    (continuing)
                You can have the two bottom drawers.

                in here. I want to be ready when my
                daddy comes for me.
Frances cracks open her steamer trunk, which parts vertically,
like a mini-closet. Elsie's eyes flare at the burst of color --
dresses, shoes, beads -- the brightness lights up the room. Elsie
pulls out a colorful print dress.

                         ELSIE
                    (almost to herself)

                angels now.

Frances touches a small snapshot edged into a corner of the
steamer's vanity mirror. It's of a fancy lady. Elsie looks in
over her shoulder.

                         ELSIE
                She's beautiful.

                         FRANCES
                Isn't she? Daddy says I have her
                hair.

Elsie nods in agreement.    She hands the colorful dress back to
Frances.

                    (continuing)
                How long have you and Aunt Polly
                been wearing black?

                         ELSIE
                Joseph died a year and four months
                ago.

                         FRANCES
                That's long enough isn't it?

                         ELSIE
                Usually...but, you see...Joseph was
                my mum's favorite.

                    (case solved)
                Well, I guess that's you now.

As Elsie considers the irony, Frances points out the window.

                    (continuing)

EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - DAY                                         18

Frances gallops down the grassy descent into the glen.   Elsie
follows, watching her cousin with curious interest.

Frances suddenly stops, causing Elsie to bump her from behind.

                          FRANCES
                     (awed)
                 Look, Elsie.

On the ground before them is a mysterious circle of crimson capped
toadstools (Fly Agarie.) So perfectly round is the circle that
it appears otherworldly, as if constructed with a purpose beyond
our logic, a kind of fungus Stonehenge.

                          FRANCES
                     (continuing)
                 A fairie ring.

Frances looks back at Elsie. Elsie steps up to the ring, staring
at it as if it were the strangest thing.

                          ELSIE
                     (confused)
                 How did that get there?

                          FRANCES
                 They appear overnight.
                 It's where they dance.

                          ELSIE
                 I know that.

                          FRANCES
                 Well, c'mon then, let's find them!

Frances rushes off.
                          ELSIE
                 Frances, stop.

                But that's their ring.   Elsie, they

                Don't you think I would have thought
                of that? I know more about the

                    (challenged)
                Do you really?

The following is a staccato volley of fairie knowledge one
upsmanship.

                    (continuing; fast)
                What do you call fairie magic?

                         ELSIE
                Glamour. What's a fairie's favorite
                thing to do?

                         FRANCES
                Dance.   What's their favorite drink?

                         ELSIE
                Honeysuckle dew.

                What are fairie clothes made of?

                         ELSIE
                Spider silk.

Frances looks around the glen for something really good, then
down at the fairie ring.

                    (pause)
                They can put a curse on you.

The girls shudder, then howl, as they jump around, excited by
their shared interest.

                         FRANCES
                    (excited)
                Let's call them, Elsie.

                         ELSIE
                Frances, I've tried so often sometimes
                I'm not sure if they were real at
                all.

                         FRANCES
                Maybe if we tried together. If we
                believed with all our might...

Frances reaches out to Elsie across the ring.   Elsie hesitates,
then takes her cousin's hands.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                Do you know the chant?

                         ELSIE
                Of course.

Frances starts circling the ring, performing a twisting, high
stepping dance, pulling Elsie along. Frances starts to CHANT,
slowly at first...

                         FRANCES

                Come out from your fairie bower...Come
                upon this golden hour...

Frances shoots a "get with it" look to Elsie, who joins in,
cautiously at first.

                         FRANCES/ELSIE
                Come to us we beg you please...
                fairies dancing on the breeze...
                (repeat)

A breeze tousles Elsie's hair.   A tiny twister stirs up the flowers
inside the fairie ring.
                                                             21.


Magic begins to happen... Shots of the glen under the continuing
CHANT. Wind gusts whistle through the trees, tiny novas of light
glimmer off the stream, something stirs the grass...

The girls suddenly freeze. The glen is eerily silent, except for
the tinkling of the stream -- or is it tiny laughter?

                          FRANCES
                 Look Elsie! Over by the waterfall!

A funnel of heavenly light strikes the cascade of the fall,
creating a diaphanous image in the spray. Elsie gasps.

The girls run over to the stream. On their reflections in the
water -- their mesmerized expressions illuminated by something
"glowing" before them. Something we cannot see...


INT.   COTTAGE - DINING ROOM - EVENING                             19

Dinner. Elsie and Frances sit next to each other across from
Polly. Artie is at the head of the table, inhaling his food as
usual. The girls stare at him with amazement. He notices he's
being watched. Stops mid fork.

                     (through mouthful)

The girls exchange giggle and smiles with Polly.

                 So... How have you girls been getting

                          FRANCES
                 And Elsie showed me the glen.

Polly shoots a glance toward Elsie, then back to Frances.

                         FRANCES
                No, Elsie, I meant the fairies.

Artie stops chewing.   Polly looks at Elsie, who averts her eyes.

                while y'here, but no one in this
                house believes in fairies.

Artie turns to Polly for support, but her focus is turned on
Frances, who in turn looks to Elsie for support, who continues to
stare at her plate.

                         FRANCES
                Excuse me, Uncle Artie, but Elsie
                believes in fairies. We were playing

the discussion.

KIDS of various ages sit obediently before the sour faced, MRS.
PEABODY, who painfully scratches Frances' name on the blackboard.
                                                            25.


Kids snicker and glance back at Frances, whose colorful attire
contrasts their own muted world.

From across the room Elsie glances over at Frances, waves with
her fingers. Mrs. Peabody raps her pointer, calling attention.

                         MRS PEABODY
                Children, today we have a new member
                of our class. Frances Griffiths
                would you please come up front and
                tell us about yourself.

Elsie winces as she watches Frances swagger up to the front of
the class like she owned the place.

                         FRANCES
                My name is Frances Griffiths and I
                hail from South Africa.

Whispered GIGGLES go up throughout the room.   POTSY WHITCOMB, the
class know-it-all, quickly raises her hand.

                         MRS PEABODY
                Yes, Potsy.

                         POTSY
                I'm curious, Miss Griffiths. If
                you're from South Africa, why do you
                sound so, "English?"

                         FRANCES
                Actually, I was born in England. We
                moved to South Africa when I was
                five. My daddy's a gold miner.
                    (sincere)
                And just for your information, Potsy,
                South Africa is a British dominion.
                Lots of people there sound English.
Potsy's nostrils flare at being corrected. LIZZY HAVERSHAM
politely raises her hand. Elsie glances across the aisle at Lizzy
and her friend, MORGANA PLUM, the snottiest girls in school.

                         MRS PEABODY
                Yes, Lizzy Haversham.

                         LIZZY
                Miss Griffiths, about Africa...

Lizzy exchanges a mischievous "watch this" look with Morgana.

                         LIZZY
                    (continuing)
                Is it true that most Africans are
                cannibals?
                                                            26.


Snickers from the class.

                          FRANCES
                     (matter of fact)
                 I never met any.

Morgana raises her hand, stifles a giggle.   Mrs. Peabody gives
her the "nod."

                          MRS PEABODY
                 Morgana...

                          MORGANA
                     (to Frances)
                 Um... Did you have to wear a ring
                 through your nose?

A bigger round of snickers. Frances' smile morphs to anger as
she realizes she's being made fun of. Mrs. Peabody bangs her
pointer on the desk, restoring order.

                          FRANCES
                     (with intent)
                 I didn't, though some Africans do,
                 Morgana. It's the same as wearing
                 pierced earrings. Just like the
                 ones you have on.

Morgana self consciously touches her earrings.

                          FRANCES
                     (continuing, defiantly)
                 Any more bloody stupid questions?

Gasps go up.   Elsie thunks her head down on her desk.

                          MRS PEABODY
                     (banging her pointer)
                 Miss Griffiths!


EXT.   MEADOW PATH - DAY                                          22

The meadow path is a rural short cut from Cottingley Village to
the glen. Elsie and Frances stomp through, neither looks happy.

                          FRANCES
                 Well they started it!

                          ELSIE
                 I know they did, Frances, but you
                 must try to be nicer or you'll never
                 make any friends.
                                                            27.


                         FRANCES
                I don't care. I have you...you like
                me, don't you Elsie?

                         ELSIE
                Very much.

                         FRANCES
                And I have the fairies.

                         ELSIE
                    (nods, baiting)
                And my mum. She adores you.

Elsie waits for a reply, none comes.

                         ELSIE
                    (continuing)
                In fact you two seem to be getting
                along splendidly.

Frances senses what Elsie's getting at.

                         FRANCES
                She just likes to hear about the
                fairies.

MR. TELLER, the kindly postman, rings his bell as he rides his
bike past the girls.

                         MR. TELLER
                Afternoon, ladies...

                         ELSIE
                Afternoon, Mr. Teller!

Frances gets a look in her eye then bolts after Teller.
                         FRANCES
                    (calling)
                Mr. Teller!

Teller stops his bike as Frances runs up.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                I'm expecting a very important letter
                from France. From my daddy. For
                Frances Griffiths...that's me.

Frances fidgets as Teller riffles through his inventory.

                         MR. TELLER
                Nothing today, Miss Griffiths. But
                I'll be sure to keep an eye out.
                                                              28.


Frances offers a disappointed wave as Teller rides off.    Elsie
tries to cheer her up.

                          ELSIE
                     (excited)
                 I know what we can do... Let's take
                 some cake to the fairies.

                          FRANCES
                     (brightens to the idea)
                 Yes! We'll have a tea!


INT.   DINING ROOM - DAY                                             23

Artie is sitting at the table cleaning his camera. Frances is
standing next to him, watching. Through the kitchen door we see
Elsie helping Polly prepare dinner. Occasionally, Elsie glances
out to Frances.

                          FRANCES
                     (about camera)
                 It all seems terribly complicated,
                 Uncle Artie.

                          ARTIE
                 Not really. See here...

Artie demonstrates the use of the camera to Frances, who secretly
signals to Elsie in the kitchen.

                          ARTIE
                     (continuing)
                 All y'do is slip one of these
                 negatives in this slot... Look
                 through here like this...

INT.   KITCHEN - SAME TIME                                           24

Elsie sneaks behind Polly's back and steals some cake out of a
cabinet. She signals back "okay" to Frances.

Through the door we see Artie lower the camera, Frances is gone.
Polly turns, Elsie is gone too. Polly and Artie share a bewildered
look.

Tossing scraps into the trash, Polly notices the crumpled flyer.


EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - SHORT TIME LATER                            25

Polly stealthily moves down into the glen.     She pulls back some
brush, watches in stunned silence.
                                                           29.


Elsie and Frances are sitting inside a patch of tall heather.   A
subtle glow illuminates their faces from below, the source of
which is hidden to us and Polly by the heather.

                          FRANCES
                     (serving)
                 More cake anyone?

                          ELSIE
                     (looking down, giggling)
                 That was a delightful story, Rosamund.

                          FRANCES
                 Sir Henry wants to hear it again.
                     (aside to Elsie)
                 He's got a crush on her.
                     (downward to Sir Henry)
                 You do so.

We hear an odd noise, sort of a cat yowl.

                          ELSIE
                     (gasps, then giggles)
                 Oh, no...Mr. Bandylegs spilled again.

                           FRANCES
                      (looking down)
                 I quite agree, gnomes are not a tidy
                 lot.

On Polly, who watches, fascinated. She doesn't notice Artie's
head rising up behind her, trying to see whatever it is she's
trying to see.

                          ARTIE
                 What're we lookin' for?

Polly jumps, startled by Artie's presence. Indignantly, she pushes
out past Artie, exiting the glen. Artie's left with a confused
look.


INT.   COTTAGE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON               26

Continue Artie's confused look as he stares down at the wrinkled
theosophy flyer. Polly is walking away from him pinning a hat to
her head.

                          ARTIE
                 Polly, why're y'doin' this?

Polly stops in front of Joseph's door, turns back to Artie.

                          POLLY
                 I don't know.
                                                              30.


                          ARTIE
                 Angels? Be reasonable, Polly, it's
                 rubbish. You've said it y'self.
                 You'd be better off spendin' more
                 time with the livin'.

                            POLLY
                 Meaning?

                          ARTIE
                 You know perfectly well what I mean.
                 Your daughter needs you. Instead
                 you sit around holdin' on t'...

Joseph's name catches in Artie's throat.     Polly lets it hang,
then...

                          POLLY
                 You can't even say his name.

Polly turns and moves downstairs.     Artie follows.

                          ARTIE
                 Let me come with y'then.    It'll be
                 dark soon.

                          POLLY
                 Thank you, I can manage.

Artie steps in front of the door, blocking her passage. Polly's
stare sweeps him aside, and she's gone. Artie presses his head
against the door.


INT.   COTTINGLEY TOWN HALL - NIGHT                                 27

High windows and rough hewn beams loom over the hall packed to
capacity with VILLAGERS, many of whom, Polly included, are either
wearing black clothing or black arm bands.

E.L. GARDNER, a thin, impeccably dressed man, with a childlike
passion for his subject, lectures from a podium in the front of
the hall. He owns this audience.

                          GARDNER
                     (very expressive)
                 Do theosophists believe in angels?
                     (continuing)
                 The answer is an emphatic "yes." I
                 believe angels are here now, watching
                 over us.

Through the crowd, eyes search the hall for angels.
                                                           31.


                          GARDNER
                     (continuing)
                 Theosophists believe that all things
                 are possessed of a guiding spirit.
                 Humans have angels; forests have
                 gnomes; and just ask any child who
                 it is that tends our gardens --
                 they'll answer quite correctly...
                 fairies. What a pity that we as
                 adults all too often discourage the
                 natural perceptions of our young.

The comment strikes Polly in the heart.

A SOUR FACED MAN gets up and heads for the door shaking his head.

                          SOUR FACED MAN
                     (loud to himself)
                 Fairies... Poppycock!

JOHN FERRET, a short, gangly reporter notes the departure with an
interested smirk. As he scribbles in his note pad...

                          FERRET
                     (to himself)
                 Poppycock...


INT.   COTTINGLEY TOWN HALL - LATER                                  28

As people file out, Gardner is at the door handing out literature.
As Polly passes, Gardner offers a pamphlet. Polly smiles politely.

                          POLLY
                 No, thank you.

                          GARDNER
                 Still a doubter, I think.
                          POLLY
                 My son believed in fairies.

Gardner notes Polly's black dress and sad eyes.

                          GARDNER
                 I'm sure he's a wonderful boy.

                          POLLY
                 Yes, he was.

                          GARDNER
                 Madam, he still is.

The remark upsets and effects Polly as she moves off.
                                                              32.


INT.   SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT                      29

Elsie, in her nightclothes, knocks on the door of the loo.

                          ELSIE
                 Frances, are you still in there?

Across the hall she notices a stripe of light escaping from under
Joseph's door. She gasps.


INT.   JOSEPH'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME                                 30

Elsie pushes the door. It swings open revealing Frances at
Joseph's desk, leafing through a folder with "glen drawings"
written across it.

                          ELSIE
                     (terrified whisper)
                 Frances, what're you doing in here?!

                            FRANCES
                 Shhhhhh!

Elsie cautiously enters, closes the door behind her.

                          ELSIE
                 If mum catches us...

The room suddenly closes in on Elsie, flooding her with emotion.
It's like a Joseph museum. On a shelf, a toy soldier stands guard
before a miniature twig house. Elsie picks it up, twirls it in
her hand.

                          FRANCES
                     (looking into folder)
                 He did know the fairies, didn't he?
Frances shows Elsie the folder (we do not see its contents.)

                          ELSIE
                 Oh yes, better than anyone.

Elsie closes the folder and puts it back into the drawer.

                          FRANCES
                 I think Aunt Polly wants to know
                 them, too.

                          ELSIE
                 She never wanted to before.
                     (continuing)
                 She wouldn't even let us talk about
                 them.
                                                              33.


                            FRANCE
                 Why not?

Elsie stares down at the toy soldier.     Hunches her shoulders.

                          ELSIE
                 She said Joseph had a "future." She
                 didn't want him wasting his time in
                 make believe.

                          FRANCES
                 Make believe?

The girls look at each other then break out laughing. They're
jolted to attention by the muffled sound of the front door
slamming. They quickly sneak out.


INT.   SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                                31

Elsie and Frances look downstairs through the stair railing.
Polly has just entered. She's falls into Artie's arms, crying.

The girls exchange nervous glances.


INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                            32

Elsie and Frances are in bed -- wide eyed, silent and frightened
as they listen to Artie and Polly arguing downstairs.

                          POLLY (O.S.)
                 And what if Joseph was right?!

                          ARTIE (O.S.)
                 Listen to y'self, Polly.

                           POLLY (O.S.)
                 All those times he tried to tell me
                 about the fairies. I should have
                 believed him... What if he was
                 right...?

                          ARTIE (O.S.)
                 Yeah, what then, Polly?
                     (continuing)
                 You think he's down there with 'em
                 in the glen? Is that what y'think?

                          POLLY (O.S.)
                 I don't know, I can't think!

Elsie anxiously clasps her hands over her chest...
                                                           34.


                          ELSIE
                     (wishing out loud)
                 Oh, I wish she could see them...


EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - MORNING                                      33

The glen is washed in golden light. A playful breeze is operating,
stirring things to life. There's an urgency to the stream not
seen before. On Elsie stooped by the fall, a faint glow
illuminates her face.

                          ELSIE
                     (toward the light)
                 Oh please, pretty Rosamund. Won't
                 you ask your queen if she'll allow
                 it? For my mum. I give my word no
                 one else will ever know.

Frances rushes in wearing a heavy coat. Elsie spins around.
From under the coat, Frances pulls out Artie's camera.

                          ELSIE
                     (continuing)
                 Dad's camera? Are you mad!

                          FRANCES
                 Here, help me.

Frances hands Elsie the camera, then takes out two glass plate
negatives.

                          ELSIE
                 What're we doing?

                          FRANCES
                 We're going to show your mum the
                 fairies.
Frances takes back the camera, fumbles as she slides in a negative.

                          ELSIE
                 Frances, they'd never allow it.

                          FRANCES
                 I have a way.

                           ELSIE
                 We musn't betray them. They could
                 put a curse on us. Frances, they
                 trust us.

Frances holds up the loaded camera to Elsie.
                                                               35.


                           FRANCES
                 Oh, Elsie, please let's try...for
                 your mum.

Elsie hesitates, takes the camera.


INT.   CUPBOARD UNDER THE STAIRS - ARTIE'S DARKROOM - NIGHT          34

A bare bulb lights the tiny space. Artie is preparing trays of
photographic solution. On a shelf by the door, a stack of exposed
glass plate negatives await developing. Artie searches a shelf
for solution, mumbles to himself as he can't find it. He opens
the door and steps out.

Mysteriously, a small hand reaches in and adds two more glass
plate negatives to the stack.

Artie returns with the solution. He sets a piece of red glass
over the bulb, turning the room crimson. He reaches for the
negatives...

Artie sloshes a print in the solution, then close on the print as
an image comes to life... It's of Frances posed before a band of
dancing fairies.

                          ARTIE
                 What in the...


INT.   OUTSIDE CUPBOARD DOOR - NIGHT                                 35

Elsie and Frances shuffle about, all nerves and giggles.   The
door suddenly blasts open, Artie steps out...

                          ARTIE
                     (top of lungs)
                 Elsie!!!
All are startled.


INT.   KITCHEN - A SHORT TIME LATER                                  36

CLOSE ON the fully developed B&W PHOTO of Frances posed in front
of a band of dancing fairies. Artie is flanked by Elsie and
Frances who are itching with excitement. Frances casts a sparkling
glance over to Elsie. Artie drops another photo on the table --
this one of Elsie and a miniature man-like "thing."

                          ARTIE
                 That another fairie?

                          FRANCES
                 Oh no, that's Mr. Bandylegs.
                                                            36.

                     (dryly)
                 The gnome.

Frances, nods. Artie runs his hand over his face then casts a
serious glance down on the girls.

                          ARTIE
                     (continuing)
                 All right, now, the game's over.
                 How'd you do it?

                          FRANCES
                 Do what, Uncle?

                             ARTIE
                 Elsie...?

Elsie locks eyes with Frances, for an eternity it seems.

                          ELSIE
                 We just snapped the photos, Dad.
                 They're for mum.

                          FRANCES
                     (excited)
                 Wait 'till she sees them.

                           ARTIE
                 Oh no.   She'll never set eyes on
                 these.   I guarantee y'that.

Frances gives Elsie a crestfallen look.


INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT                                    37

Frances sneaks out of bed, careful not to wake Elsie.

INT.   SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT                             38

Frances sneaks up to a door, knocks, then hurries up the attic
stairs. The door opens, it's Polly in night clothes. She looks
down the hall, perplexed.


INT.   KITCHEN - SAME TIME                                           39

Artie in bed clothes, is sitting at the table examining the photos
with a magnifying glass. It's obvious he's clueless. Polly
enters, surprising him.

                          POLLY
                 Artie, did you knock...?
                                                              37.


Artie leans forward over the table, desperately trying to cover
up the photos.

                          POLLY
                     (continuing; notices)
                 What have you got there?

                          ARTIE
                 Nothin'...

Polly gestures for Artie to "get up."    He does.   Polly examines
the photos.


INT.   ATTIC STAIRS - LATE NIGHT                                       40

Polly is climbing the stairs.     Artie follows, close on her heals.

                          ARTIE
                 Now, Polly, it's not what y'think.


INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT                                      41

The light jumps on. Polly enters, photos in hand. Artie's
silhouette remains outside the door. The girls sit up, Elsie
rubbing her eyes, Frances faking grogginess.

                          POLLY
                     (off photos)
                 They're real, aren't they?

In unison, the girls nod "yes."

                          POLLY
                     (continuing; confirmed)
                 My God, Joseph was right.

EXT.   BRADFORD TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM - MORNING                     42

The train is spewing STEAM, ready for departure. Gardner rushes
over the platform, frantically searching for his car.

                          POLLY (O.S.)
                 Mr. Gardner!

Gardner glances back, but doesn't slow down as Polly hurries up
beside him, trying to keep pace.

                          GARDNER
                     (huffing and puffing)
                 Forgive me, Madam, my train.

TRAIN WHISTLE!   The CONDUCTOR leans out from a car.

                          CONDUCTOR
                 All aboard!

The train jerks, then slowly lunges forward. At the last moment,
Gardner finds his car and steps up, away from Polly. She sidesteps
along with the train.

                          GARDNER
                     (winded)
                 Perhaps when I'm in Bradford again...

                 Please have a look at these.   I must
                 know what you think!

Polly thrust the envelope into Gardner's hand as the train picks
up speed and noise, leaving Polly behind in the steam's mist.

                          POLLY
                     (continuing, softer)
                 Could they be real...?


INT.   FIRST CLASS TRAIN CAR - DAY                                   43

Gardner nods politely as he stumbles into the ritzy club car with
its silver and velvet appointments and HIGHBROW PASSENGERS. He
collapses into a chair, heaves a relieved breath.

A beat later, he looks down into his lap at the envelope. He
pulls out the photos and negatives. Close on his reaction of
total annihilation.
                          GARDNER
                     (loud)
                 Good heavens!!

Snooty heads turn toward him.


INT.   SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY                                          44

Frances walks alone through the hall past Lizzy, Morgana and a
few other snickering girls.

                          LIZZY
                     (teasing Frances)

               I know you don't have any friends.

                        FRANCES
               I do so have friends.

                         LIZZY
               Really?   Where are they?

               In the glen...behind Elsie's house.

                        FRANCES
               They're not people.

                        LIZZY
               What are they?   Frogs?

                        FRANCES
               No...they're fairies.

                         MORGANA
               Liar.

                        FRANCES
               I am not a liar!    Ask Elsie.

Up the hall Elsie spots the commotion. Instinctively, she knows
it's Frances. She pushes into the fray.

                        ELSIE
               Frances, what's the matter?

                        LIZZY
               Your cousin says you have photos of
               fairies.

                          ELSIE

Elsie leads Frances off down the hall.

                     (continuing)
                 How could you. Those photos were
                 for my mum, not those silly girls.

                 do you hear?!


INT.   SNELLING'S STUDIO LAB - NIGHT                                 45

The photo of Frances and the fairies is magnified. We are viewing
it through a photographic loop in the studio of the mole-like, H.
SNELLING, the district's foremost expert on photographic fakery.
Light tables, machines, back drops, cameras -- it's an impressive,
completely photographic world. Gardner anxiously peers over
Snelling's shoulder as he carefully examines the fairie negatives.

                 Photographic fakery is an art, Mr.
                 Gardner. No, what you have here are
                 untouched, open air, single exposure

                 And the fairies?

                          SNELLING
                 Personally, I don't know fairies
                 from fireflies, but look 'ere at the
                 wings...
                                                           41.


At Snelling's prompting Gardner examines the photos through the
loop. CUT into magnification where we see that the fairie wings
are blurred, partially double exposed.

                          SNELLING (O.S.)
                     (continuing)
                 At the time of exposure...the wings
                 were moving.

Gardner rises from the loop with growing exhilaration.

                          GARDNER
                 The photos...they're genuine, then?

                          SNELLING
                 As the King's beard.

Gardner grabs his hat and hurries to the door.


INT.   HOTEL LOBBY - DESK - DAY                                     46

Gardner hurries up to the front desk carrying a large envelope.
Handing it to the YOUNG CLERK.

                          GARDNER
                 Young man, please have this parcel

INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - NIGHT                                        47

Darkness, as a wooden match strikes, illuminating Elsie's serious
face. She draws the match down and lights a thick candle set on
the floor between her and Frances, both in nightclothes.

Sitting across from each other, their expectant faces are washed
in the yellow light of the candle -- a deep, rich, emotional
yellow. In their quiet stillness, a perfect Vermeer study.
                                                           42.


                         FRANCES
                This is wonderfully mysterious, Elsie.
                What are we going to do?

                         ELSIE
                    (hushed)
                We're going to make a promise,
                Frances.

                         FRANCES
                    (excited)
                Are we? What kind?

                         ELSIE
                The kind that lasts forever.   Now,
                hold out your thumb.

Frances does. Elsie tilts the candle and pours a drip of wax
onto Frances' thumb. Frances winces from the momentary burn.
Elsie then pours a drip onto her own thumb, then presses hers
against Frances', scattering the tail of smoke rising up from the
candle.

                         FRANCES
                    (bubbling)
                This is so exciting!

                Be serious, Frances.

                          FRANCES
                Sorry.   I Frances Griffiths...

                         ELSIE
                Hereby on this day swear never again
                to break the code of fairie secrecy.
                    (squinting at Frances)
                Say it.

                         FRANCES
                    (reluctant)
                ...swear never to break the code of

Their thumbs part. Frances gets a playful glint in her eye. She
sits straight up and waves her hands over the candle, imitating a
medium.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing, with accent)
                Spirits of the dead...
                We call to youuuuuuuuuu....

The candle unexpectedly blows out. The girls scream and scramble
into their beds, giggling in goose bump terror. After a beat...

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                Elsie... What happens if we break
                our promise?

                         ELSIE
                    (after a beat)
                We won't. Go to sleep.


INT. SIR ARTHUR'S WINDLESHAM ESTATE, SUSSEX - DRAWING ROOM -         48
NIGHT

A dark room, a round table, a half dozen well heeled guests, and
a deathly pale old woman, MADAME POZLENSKA, in the throes of a
convulsion. The formally dressed guests, four men and two women,
look on in terror. Pozlenska screams, then saucer-eyed, points
toward a corner of the room. Heads turn. One of the ladies,
CAMILLE, is jolted out of her chair. In a dark corner of the
room, a smokey, spectral image of a YOUNG SOLDIER in uniform,
appears. He's reaching out...

                         CAMILLE
                    (recognizing the image)
                Michael!
                         MICHAEL
                    (distant)
                Mother... I miss you mother...

                         CAMILLE
                    (excited, crying)
                Here, my baby... Mother's here...

Camille reaches out to Michael, but is held back by a huge bear
of a man with droopy eyes and a walrus moustache, SIR ARTHUR CONAN
DOYLE.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                    (a true believer)
                Madam don't! You'll break the
                connection.
                                                           44.


                          MADAME POZLENSKA
                     (Eastern European accent,
                      to Emily)
                 Mama is here, dear Michael...

Surprising everyone, the most timid-looking of the guests, a MAN
wearing a Van Dyke beard and thick spectacles, stands and brings
his walking stick down on the table with a resounding WHACK!

                           TIMID GUEST
                 Enough!   Enough of this!

                          MADAME POZLENSKA
                 And who are you?!

All eyes turn toward the timid guest, who peels off a fake beard
and removes the spectacles.

                          TIMID GUEST
                     (loud, American accent)
                 I am the great Harry Houdini, and
                 you Madame, are a fraud!

Houdini reaches over with his walking stick and yanks back a small
curtain, revealing a hidden projector. He whacks the projector,
which sends the image of the Michael spinning wildly around the
room. Camille faints.

                           POZLENSKA
                     (busted)
                 Oh, shit.


INT.   DRAWING ROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER                             49

Sir Arthur and Houdini examine the projector. Though Sir Arthur
stands nearly a head taller than Houdini, the great magician's
strong physical presence is just as intimidating.
                          SIR ARTHUR
                     (off projector)
                 Amazing. They had scarcely thirty
                 minutes to prepare the room.

                          HOUDINI
                 I've seen it done in fifteen.

Other guests crowd around Houdini, including Sir Oliver Lodge,
and the clairvoyant, Geoffrey Hodson.

                          HODSON
                 Mr. Houdini, being a clairvoyant
                 myself, am I to assume that you
                 believe all seances are fake?
                                                              45.


                          HOUDINI
                 Only the successful ones.

                          SIR ARTHUR
                 Unlike us, Mr. Hodson, where
                 spiritualism is concerned, Mr. Houdini
                 is an unabashed skeptic.

                          HOUDINI
                 If there was a way to contact the
                 other side... I'd have found it.

                          SIR OLIVER
                 Sir Arthur, I'm curious... How would
                 your venerable Detective Holmes
                 contemplate tonight's phenomena?

                          SIR ARTHUR
                 At the end of a good pipe, Sir Oliver.
                 If you'll excuse us.

Everyone laughs as Sir Arthur draws Houdini off toward a set of
double oak doors.


INT.   SIR ARTHUR'S STUDY - LATER                                   50

Close on the photos of Frances and Elsie surrounded by fairies.
A trail of smoke mysteriously clouds over them.

Houdini hands the photos to Sir Arthur who is puffing on a
Holmesian calabash pipe.

                          HOUDINI
                 Where'd you come up with these?

                          SIR ARTHUR
                 My good friend, E.L. Gardner.
                          HOUDINI
                 Theosophists. Figures. Will you
                 never learn, Sir Arthur?

                          SIR ARTHUR
                 My friend, there is a point where
                 learning teaches you nothing.

Sir Arthur props the two photos on the mantle, giving the girls a
clear view into the room, which by the way is very "male" --dark
woods, animal trophies, guns, leather bound editions of Sherlock
Holmes novels...

                          HOUDINI
                 Banana oil.
                                                             46.


Houdini moves around the room looking behind paintings.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                I assure you, Harry, the photos have
                been proven genuine.

                         HOUDINI
                Anything can be faked.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                By two little girls?

                         HOUDINI
                By anyone.

One painting swings out, revealing a safe.   Houdini smiles,   starts
working the tumblers.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                I intend to use the photos in a piece
                I'm writing for the Strand Magazine.

                         HOUDINI
                You should be writing more Sherlock
                Holmes. I love the guy.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                I'm afraid Holmes is retired. My
                only interest now is in furthering
                the cause of spiritualism.
                    (turns to photos)
                These photos are the answer to a
                dream.
                    (infused)
                Spiritualism lives, Harry!

                         HOUDINI
                Well it ain't gonna live long if all
                you've got are those.
                    (points to photos)
                I suggest you get some back up; sworn
                statements, more pictures, whatever.
                You're going to need it.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                Point well taken.
                    (stares at the photos)
                Ah, Harry, someday you'll understand.

                         HOUDINI
                Ah, Sir Arthur, someday you're gonna
                wake up from that dream.

Houdini pops open the safe, smiles.    Sir Arthur reaches in and
snaps it shut.
                                                             47.


EXT.   COTTAGE - A FEW DAYS LATER                                     51

Elsie and Frances arriving home from school are surprised to see
a car parked in front of the cottage.


INT.   COTTAGE - PARLOR - DAY                                         52

The girls enter. Polly is having tea with Mr. Gardner, who stands,
almost reverently, upon seeing the girls.

                          POLLY
                 Frances, Elsie, this is Mr. Gardner.

                          GARDNER
                 How do you do.

The girls glance at each other and force smiled replies.

                           POLLY
                 Mr. Gardner had your fairie photos
                 tested...

The girl's faces blanch.

                          GARDNER
                 Merely as a precaution, of course.

                          POLLY
                 I must say I had my doubts...

Polly reaches for the photos on the table.   Smiles down at them.

                          GARDNER
                 Oh, they're quite real.
                     (excited, to girls)
                 How did you do it?
Elsie's knees shake.   Frances leans in to steady her.

                          POLLY
                 I assured Mr. Gardner you wouldn't
                 mind taking more photos.

                          ELSIE
                 I don't think it's such a good idea.

Polly glances at Elsie, then to Mr. Gardner, embarrassed.   Frances
watches the exchange.

                          FRANCES
                     (to the rescue)
                 It would be our pleasure, Mr. Gardner.
                                                           48.


Gardner smiles. Polly brightens and strokes Frances' hair. Elsie
is furious at being upstaged in front of her mother. She glares
at Frances, grabs her by the arm and pulls her off toward the
stairs.

                          ELSIE
                     (feigning politeness)
                 It'll just take us a moment to change,
                 Mr. Gardner...

The girls move up the stairs, out of earshot.

                          ELSIE
                     (continuing; angry
                      whisper, to Frances)
                 Are you mad?!

                 What a handsome server, Mrs. Wright.

                          POLLY
                 Why thank you, Mr. Gardner. It's
                 been in my family for generations.
                 I'm originally from Leeds, you know.

The girls come down the stairs in new clothes.

                          GARDNER
                 Ah, here they are.
Frances reaches into the cupboard and pulls out Artie's old camera.

                     (continuing)
                 Just a minute...

Gardner holds up a new, expensive-looking camera.

                     (continuing, magnanimous)
                 Try this.

Gardner hands the camera to Elsie, who perfunctorily examines it
while darting looks over to Frances, who subtly hunches her
shoulders.

                          GARDNER
                 The operation is the same.    I made
                 certain of it.

The girls exchange a significant worried look.


EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - DAY                                        54

Elsie and Frances run with abandon down the slope into the woodsy
glen. Gardner, dressed in tweed and carrying the camera, tries
to keep up.

In the heart of the glen, streaks of sunlight reach down through
the breezing trees, stirring up color in patches of wild flowers.

Gardner stumbles in and stops by the stream to catch his breath.
For the first time he has a chance to take in the beauty
surrounding him.

Gardner looks around then, down. He's standing inside the fairie
ring. Instinctively, he jumps out.

                 Quite true. I was foolish.     Not
                 paying attention.

Frances parts the thicket of heather like curtains, revealing the
miniature twig dining furniture. The table is upset and the
remnants of fresh dew are clearly visible, spilled over from the
tiny acorn cups. A chair, decorated with vine tendrils and
hydrangea petals, is fallen over, as if kicked back in haste.

Elsie and Gardner fill in behind Frances.    Gardner gasps.

Gardner reaches in to touch the furniture.    Both girls grab his
arm and topple him back on his rear end.

                     (continuing)
                 But if I may, Frances, I believe a
                 "bower" is where fairies bathe.

An eerie wind whips through the trees.    Elsie glances around
nervously.

                         ELSIE
                We should leave now, Frances.

                         GARDNER
                Oh, no, please. I'll be more careful.
                I give you my word.

Frances whispers in Elsie's ear.    Elsie reluctantly nods.

                         FRANCES
                This way, Mr. Gardner.

Frances takes the camera from Gardner, hands it to Elsie, then
leads him behind some brush.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                You wait here. Don't move. We're
                going to try to chase them back this
                way so you can have a look. Remember,
                don't move.

                         GARDNER
                I'm glued to the spot.

Elsie and Frances run off, disappearing into the glen with the
camera. Gardner is hyperalert, watching through the brush.

Artie strides into the glen toward Gardner, whose attention is
fixed.

                         ARTIE
                Mr. Gardner?

                         GARDNER
                Oh, Mr. Wright...    A pleasure.

Gardner extends his hand, they shake, though Gardner's attention
is clearly focused in the glen.

                         ARTIE
                What's all this business 'bout you

                    (turns to Artie)
                I assure you, Mr. Wright. My only
                hope was that the girls might try
                for more photos. Beyond that, the
                gift is theirs without encumbrance.

We hear the girls voices in the distance.   Gardner spins back
toward the glen.

                         ARTIE
                What're ye...?

                         GARDNER
                Sssh. The girls are herding the
                fairies back this way.

                         ARTIE
                Fairies...? I can't believe you're
                falling for this rubbish.

Without taking his eyes off the glen.

                         GARDNER
                    (eyes in glen)
                I'm quite certain both girls are
                clairvoyants and perhaps mediums as
                well. Together they create an etheric
                field which allows the fairies to
                metabolize subtle amounts of ectoplasm
                into their bodies... that's how the
                girls are able to capture them on
                film.
Gardner glances back at Artie, who wears an incredulous look.

Artie's had enough.   He moves into the glen, calling...

                          ARTIE
                Elsie!   Frances!   Come 'ere!

Gardner desperately tries to coax him back.

                 Mr. Gardner, the girls took a couple
                 of snaps in the glen, of what or how

Frances runs up and presents Gardner with three newly exposed
glass plate negatives. Elsie pulls up behind with the camera.
Artie stares at them both with total confusion.

Inside a dark cavernous studio, giant ten foot images of three
new fairie exposures are projected onto the face of an entire
wall. The first is of Frances and a leaping fairie; next, a fairie
offers a posy to Elsie; and the last is of fairies gathered around
a cocoon bath, referred to as the "fairy bower."

The BLACK SILHOUETTE of a Kodak technician is perched on a rolling
ladder, moving back and forth over the images like a fly on glass.

Sir Arthur and Gardner sit at one end of a long table. At the
other end, the Kodak contingent, consisting of their American
solicitor general, MR. BINLEY; Chief technician, MR. WEST; and a
FEMALE STENOGRAPHER. The giant images are visible through the
glass wall.

Binley opens a file set before him.

                          BINLEY
                     (clears his throat)
                 Gentlemen, our preliminary findings
                 suggest that the negatives may indeed
                 be untouched single exposures.

Gardner subtlety nudges Sir Arthur.
                                                              54.

                However...these findings cannot be
                taken as conclusive.

Gardner absorbs the slap in the face.   He stirs uneasily.   Sir
Arthur is stoic, unmoved.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                How is that, Sir?

                         BINLEY
                Well, the possibility still exists
                that a clever operator of consummate
                skill might have made them
                artificially. Therefore, I regret
                that Kodak must deny your request
                for a certificate of authenticity.

                         GARDNER
                Clever operator?
                    (gestures toward the
                     photos)
                My word, gentlemen, the girls are
                eight and ten years old. Of the
                artisan class no less. What
                cleverness would you afford them?

Sir Arthur places a calming hand on Gardner's arm.

                    (closes folder)
                I'm sorry.

Mr. West flicks his folder closed with an incredulous shake of
his head. Gardner takes offense.

                Really now, gentlemen. You are asking
                of Kodak nothing less than to verify
                the existence of fairies. Who next,
                Father Christmas?

Sir Arthur rises to his full intimidating height.

                Gentlemen, I accept your decision,
                though not your findings.
                If these photographs are true, and I
                believe they are, then we are faced

                 than Columbus' discovery of the new
                 world. More important than King
                 Arthur's Holy Grail. For such a
                 discovery will change the very fabric
                 of human life for all time. In this
                 regard I accept Kodak's unwillingness
                 to bear the burden of proof. None-
                 the-less, the photos speak for
                 themselves.
                 And what is, gentlemen, simply, "is."

Sir Arthur collects his hat and umbrella.

With great dignity, Sir Arthur and Gardner exit the room. Through
the glass their silhouettes move across the projected photos.

EXT.   COUNTRY ROAD - BY WIGGINS MANOR - DAY                         64

A CHAUFFEUR driven Rolls Royce speeds along. Wiggins' airedale
dogs stretch their heads out the windows, biting the air.

Inside the Rolls, Lord Wiggins reacts to the Strand article.

                          LORD WIGGINS
                     (surprised)
                 Good heavens. On my property?!

Outside, as the car moves off the magazine flies out the window.


INT.   SMILEY'S PUB - DAY                                            65

The reporter John Ferret sits at a back table pecking on a bad
typewriter, a cheap cigar stuck to his lip. The bartender, SMILEY,
is reading the Strand.
                          SMILEY
                     (to Ferret)
                 Well, what do y'know. They've
                 discovered fairies in Yorkshire.

                          FERRET
                 Poppycock.

                          SMILEY
                 Not accordin' to Sir Arthur Conan
                 Doyle?

Interested, Ferret moves to the bar, grabs the magazine.   As he
stares at the photos a cynical smile grows on his face.
                                                              57.

                          FERRET
                 A first class ticket outta here.

Ferret slams the magazine down on the bar and moves out.    Smiley
smiles a five-tooth smile down at the girl's pictures.


INT.   COTTINGLEY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                             66

Elsie and Frances are walking up the hall.     They pass Lizzy,
Morgana and their snooty clique.

                          LIZZY
                 Seen any fairies lately, Frances?

Frances exaggerates a look at the group.

                          FRANCES
                 No, just a bunch of toads!

Elsie grabs Frances' arm and pulls her away.


EXT.   COTTINGLEY SCHOOL - DAY                                       67

KIDS, including Elsie and Frances, scramble down the steps at the
end of the day.

                          ARTIE (O.S.)
                     (loud, urgent)
                 Elsie! Frances!
The girls are surprised by his appearance.     He's frantically
motioning them over to the lorry.

                 What is it, Dad?

                     (rushing)
                 In you go.

He lifts them both into the back of the lorry at the same time,
jumps up on his seat and snaps the reins with a loud "yah!"

                          ELSIE
                 Dad, what's going on?     What's the

                                                             58.


The Strand magazine comes flying back into Elsie's lap.    The girls
react to their own photos.

                          ELSIE
                     (continuing, devastated)

                 France? They get the damn thing in
                 the North Pole!

The girls look at each other, one near tears, the other bursting
with excitement.


EXT.   COTTAGE - DAY                                                   68

The lorry rolls up. A small crowd of CURIOUS NEIGHBORS mill around
trying to look unobtrusive. Artie waves them off. TOMMY McGILL,
a slight man with a good suit steps up.

                          TOMMY
                 So, what's this all about, Artie?

                           ARTIE
                 Nothin', Tommy. It's all rubbish.

                      (not fast enough)
                 Now!

The girls run into the house as John Ferret, steps up to the door.
                          FERRET
                 Girls! I'd like to ask you a few
                 questions!

                 Did Sir Arthur put y'up to it?!

Artie shoves Ferret off.   He stumbles back on his rear.

                          ARTIE
                     (to Ferret)

                 caretaker's cottage belong to the

Artie steps inside and slams the door shut.


INT.   PARLOR - DAY                                                  69

Polly stares out the window. Behind her Artie is moving through
the room snapping curtains closed. The girls are on the settle
chair reading the article. Artie reaches in and snaps the curtains
shut in front of Polly.

                          ARTIE
                     (grumbling)
                 They've even got Sir Arthur believin'
                 in fairies.

Polly moves in behind the couch where the girls are reading the
magazine.

                     (reading out loud)

Elsie glances back at Polly, fishing for approval.    None coming
as Polly leans in over Frances' shoulder.

                     (disappointed)

Artie sneaks a pained peek out the window.

                     (commenting on crowd)

Artie rubs his face in frustration.

                          ARTIE
                 Enough with the bloody fairies!   Now

                 Don't "but dad" me.   It's your fault,
                 all this. Go on!

Elsie's eyes cloud up as she runs up the stairs past Frances.


INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         70

The girls are getting ready for bed in silence.

                 glen in the morning. We'll talk to
                 the fairies. They'll understand.
                 It'll be all right. I promise.

Elsie looks away in frustration.   Frances hopes she's right.


INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - EARLY NEXT MORNING                            71
The girls are awakened by the sound of clamoring VOICES. They
scramble to the window. Outside, an unruly crowd of PEOPLE are
descending into the glen.


INT.   SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - SAME TIME                              72

Artie steps out of the loo brushing his teeth as Elsie and Frances
fly down the stairs in their nightclothes.

EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - EARLY MORNING                              73

The crowd descends the slope like locusts.

THRONGS OF PEOPLE tramp through the glen in search of fairies.
Couples, families, kids from school, cripples, the infirm, the
elderly, soldiers...

Elsie moves through the crowd waving her arms frantically.

                          ELSIE
                 Go away! You don't understand!
                 You're hurting them!

An ELDERLY LADY shambles through tossing breadcrumbs.

                 sending them away!

The lady ignores Elsie, who's inadvertently knocked back into a
puddle of mud. Frances shields her from being trampled.

A MAN IN ROBES walks through hooting and beating a drum.

INTO THE HEATHER, where the miniature twig dining set is still in
place. A large boot steps down and crushes it to dust.

The WATERFALL, as paper wrappers, assorted trash, spill over.

A KID reaches under a stream rock.
                          KID
                 I caught one!

A crowd wedges in around the kid, who slowly pulls out his hand.
In it is a croaking TOAD.

                     (continuing)
                 Is this a fairie?

Leaning against a nearby tree, Ferret takes wicked delight in the
spectacle as he scribbles notes in his pad.

Wiggins and his Airedales are hunting pheasant in the high grass.
The dogs start barking and take off.

EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - SAME TIME                                     75

The Airedales gallop into the crowd, splashing and frolicking in
the stream.

A loud gun blast rings out. Everyone freezes as Lord Wiggins
shambles down into the glen poised with his shotgun.

                          WIGGINS
                 Off my property! Get out!     The lot
                 of you! Off! Go on!

He empties another barrel into the air.     People panic and scatter
in every direction.

Artie scrambles down into the glen in his nightshirt. From behind
he sees a man with a shotgun. Valiantly, Artie tackles him and
wrestles the gun away. It takes a beat for him to recognize who
it is.

                          ARTIE
                     (shocked)

Artie apologizes profusely as he helps Wiggins up, brushing off
his clothes.

                     (continuing)
                 I'm so sorry, Sir... I thought...

Wiggins indignantly wrests his gun back from Artie.      Elsie and
Frances awkwardly witness the exchange.

                          WIGGINS
                     (pushing Artie away)

Elsie turns away, pained by her father's humiliation.

                             ARTIE

Wiggins storms off up the slope, the dogs sloppily following.

Artie, angry and humiliated, glares at the girls.

Polly is sitting across from a kind faced, nicely dressed young
reporter, MR. SEWELL.

                 Yes, he believed in them all along...

                          SEWELL
                 It must have been difficult. I mean,
                 most people are fairly closed minded
                 about that sort of thing.

Polly heaves a breath of regret, then is startled as Artie kicks
open the door, pushing the girls in ahead of himself. His
nightshirt muddied, his neck red with anger. Sewell stands.

                             ARTIE
                 Who's he?

                 Artie, I'd like you to meet Mr.

Sewell reaches out to shake hands.

                          SEWELL
                 Nice to meet you, Sir...

Artie grabs Sewell's hand and brusquely ushers him out the door.
Elsie and Frances head for the stairs.

Artie grabs the unfinished sweater out of the knitting basket.

Polly stops. For a sobering moment, for the first time in a long
time, she's feeling pain that's not her own. She crumbles to the
floor crying. Elsie stares at her, then runs out.

Wind swirls at her feet, her nightgown flutters, it's as if she's
about to be swept away, when...

Frances tackles her out of the ring. They tumble over and come
to a stop next to the heather. Frances holds Elsie tight.

The grayness of the sky casts a mute dreariness over the glen.
The girls, groaning and out of breath, set the doll house down in
the heather clearing. Elsie places a morsel of cake on the tiny
dining room table and fills a porcelain thimble with cool water.
Frances creates a garden around the house with flowers.

At the fairie ring, the girls join hands and begin their dance.

                 I'm so stupid. We never should have
                 taken those photos. Why did I listen
                 to you?

                 and we're going back home and we're
                 going to be together forever!

Upset, Frances runs off.

EXT.   ANOTHER PART OF THE GLEN - SAME TIME                         86
Deeper into the glen, the shadows grow larger. Frances runs in,
slows as she's overcome with the willies. Leaves crunch behind
her. She spins around.

                          FRANCES
                     (tentative)
                 Elsie? Is that you?

No answer. Growing panic sets her heart pounding. She walks
faster, then starts to run. With jarring suddenness a DARK FIGURE
steps out in front of her! It's Ferret.

                          FERRET
                 Mornin' little Frances.

                         FRANCES
                I don't know Sir Arthur.

Ferret grabs Frances by the shoulders.

Elsie runs up, bravely steps in front of Frances.

Ferret snickers, but looks around anyway...quiet.

                         FERRET
                Sure they are...

A sudden sound of leaves crunching rises from the shadows.    Ferret
quiets. Looks around, less sure.

                         FERRET
                    (continuing, to Elsie)
                I'm on t'yer tricks, girl...

Another sound. Elsie's eyes dart behind Ferret where she catches
a glimpse of the ghostly figure in military uniform.
                                                              74.

Ferret looks around, there's nothing there.   He leans close enough
for Elsie to smell his foul breath.

                          FERRET
                 The truth now...

With shocking surprise a hand falls on Ferret's shoulder from
behind. Ferret spins around, sees what to him is a hideous
monster. He screams a womanly scream and runs off through the
glen babbling to himself.

Elsie reels back from the monster with half a face.

                     (suddenly overjoyed)
                 Corporal!

Frances runs up to the corporal and hugs him. He gently strokes
the back of her hair, looks up at Elsie. Elsie's warmed and
confused by the ravaged face, made soft with emotion.

                          CORPORAL
                 Forgive me. The photographs... I
                 had to come. I don't want to disturb
                 them, I just need to know... Are
                 they real?

The corporal looks at Frances who looks at Elsie. On the spot
again, Elsie nods, "yes." The corporal grins tearfully.

                     (continuing, with joy)

The corporal draws Elsie into the hug. Elsie gazes out into the
glen, weighing the risk of her latest betrayal.

Polly squeezes the rail, unsure about going up. Artie charges
down, stares at her for a beat, then moves past.

enters first. Silently she watches her daughter sleep.


INT.   SMILEY'S PUB - NIGHT                                        90
Half empty with drunks. Ferret's at a back table poking away at
a typewriter, a cigar sloshing back and forth across his mouth.

Artie enters the pub, engages Smiley, who points back at Ferret.

On Ferret as a shadow grows over him.

                          FERRET
                     (irritated)
                 Aye, you're blocking m'light...

Ferret has just enough time to recognize Artie, who lifts him by
the lapels and throws him back against the bar.

A hard right to the jaw, followed by a left to the midsection
sends Ferret to the floor. A kick to the behind as Ferret scurries
across the floor on hands and knees under his table. Artie flings
the table off, sending the typewriter crashing against the wall.
Artie grabs Ferret by the tie, sending every vein in his head
bulging to the surface.

                 my girls again...I'll kill ye.

Artie storms out. Smiley tries to help Ferret to his feet, but
is shrugged off. Nose bleeding, Ferret searches the floor for
his cigar, steals a shot of rye from a drunk at the bar, then
sets his typewriter back on a table. He wheels in a wrinkled
piece of paper.

We hear the faint ring of a bell. Outside the window Frances
sees Artie take a letter from Mr. Teller. She bolts for the door.

Rain. The girls, adorable in their best dresses, their hair in
ribbons and curls, stare out the window at the rain and breath
sighs of relief. In the gray distance, car headlights meander up
the road toward the cottage.

Everyone rushes around with last minute preparations. Artie stokes
the fire. Headlights fan across the window. The girls, attacked
by the willies, scrunch up close to one another.

A firm knock at the door. A beat, then Polly and Artie race for
the door. They compose themselves, then Artie magnanimously opens
the door to...Lord Wiggins, who strides in out of the rain.

Wiggins reaches back and opens the door himself. Filling the
doorway is the considerable frame of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He
strides in, sheds his wet cape onto Wiggins.

                          ARTIE

Wiggins is caught completely by surprise.

                     (jaw dropping, finishing)
                 ...Conan Doyle?!

Others enter and follow suit, piling their wet things onto Wiggins --
Houdini, Gardner, SIR OLIVER LODGE, CAMILLE FLAMMARION and GEOFFREY
HODSON.
                                                              80.


Gardner introduces Sir Arthur to Artie.

                          GARDNER
                 Sir Arthur, may I introduce Mr. Artie
                 Wright.

                          SIR ARTHUR
                     (to Artie)
                 I can't tell you how much I've been
                 looking forward to this day, Mr.
                 Wright.

Artie drops Wiggins' things, wipes his hand on his pants, and
vigorously shakes Sir Arthur's like a star-struck rube.

                          ARTIE
                     (frozen, then)

                 We can't very well stand out here
                 forever.

Elsie shakes her head.   As Frances ushers her back toward the
house...

                          FRANCES
                     (continuing)

INT.   COTTAGE - PARLOR - SAME TIME                                    100
At the door, Artie apologetically takes the wet things from
Wiggins.

                          ARTIE
                 Terribly sorry, Sir.

Wiggins is staring into the parlor, too awed to care.     Sir Arthur
gestures over his entourage.

                          SIR ARTHUR
                     (announcing)

Houdini bows theatrically.   Other guests nod and gesture as they're
introduced.

                Hodson, and of course, noted
                theosophist, E.L. Gardner.

Wiggins slides up next to Sir Arthur.

                         WIGGINS
                Well, well, Sir Arthur... I believe
                we share more than a few acquaintances
                in Parliament.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                Pardon me, Sir, but what is your
                interest here?

                         WIGGINS
                    (boastful)
                I am Lord of the manor. The fairies

                         WIGGINS
                Thank you, I shall.

Sir Arthur turns into the room.

                    (searching)
                The girls. Where are the girls?

Polly gasps. All heads turn toward the back entrance where the
girls are standing side by side, looking like a couple of drowned
rats.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                    (continuing; stepping up
                     to the girls)
                What a pleasure to meet you at last.

Sir Arthur takes Elsie's hand. She curtesies, inadvertently
dripping water onto his sleave.
                                                             82.


INT.   PARLOR - A SHORT TIME LATER                                    101

Gardner peers out the window. It's raining hard.     He turns back
into the crowded room, minus the girls.

                          GARDNER
                 We certainly can't visit the glen in
                 this rain. Perhaps with some luck
                 it'll stop.

                          SIR ARTHUR
                 The fire's warm, the company
                 excellent. I say we sit tight and
                 wait it out.

                          POLLY
                 Well then, I'll make tea.


INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - DAY                                            102

The girls are changed into regular clothes. Frances is helping
Elsie dry her hair with a towel as Polly enters.

                          ELSIE
                     (hopeful, to Polly)
                 Are they gone?

                          POLLY
                 On the contrary. They've asked to
                 hear about the fairies.

Frances lets the towel drop over Elsie's head.


INT.   PARLOR - SHORT TIME LATER                                      103

Rain patters against the windows. The air is thick and musky.
Artie stokes the fire into a crackling rage. The flames reflect
orange off the faces of the guests, who are now sitting semi circle
around it. A steamy mist rises up from their coats, creating a
magical proscenium.

Elsie and Frances step onto the hearth stage.    They assess the
eager eyes set upon them, then each other.

                          ELSIE
                 Well, um...what happened was...um...
                     (continuing, help)
                 Frances?

Frances chucks Elsie a sideways glance, then takes center stage.
She pauses, drawing her audience in. The fire flutters behind
her like angel wings. Her movements are slight and graceful.
                                                            83.


                         FRANCES
                    (beat, then mysterious)
                It happened one golden afternoon.
                Elsie and I were playing in the glen
                when we discovered a circle of
                toadstools...a fairie ring.

Guests nod to themselves, acknowledging.   Houdini stands in the
b.g., arms skeptically folded.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                We knew the fairies were around
                because Elsie and her brother Joseph
                had known them before.

Polly's eyes cloud over.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                All we had to do was to believe with
                all our might, and call to them in
                that special way...

                         GARDNER
                    (overcome)
                Call to them, girls...

                         SIR ARTHUR
                Yes, yes, please do.

                          FRANCES
                    (reaching out)
                Elsie...?

Elsie hesitates, then joins hands with her cousin.   They begin
their delicate, circular dance.
                         FRANCES/ELSIE
                    (chanting, slow at first)
                Come out from your fairie bower...
                Come upon this golden hour...

Backlit by the fiery aura, the girl's dancing shadows are projected
around the room like from a child's fantasy lamp.

                         FRANCES/ELSIE
                    (continuing chant)
                Come to us we beg you please...
                Fairies dancing on the breeze...
                    (repeating)

Sir Arthur, then Gardner, then others succumb. The lull of the
chant, the patter of the rain, the heat of the fire, the passion
of belief, all mix to create a communal magic.
                                                           84.


Move slowly into the eyes of the guests which are getting bigger
and bigger. CUT to their POV... The girls are dancing around a
real fairie ring. As the walls of the room melt away, everyone --
Sir Arthur, Gardner, Polly, Artie, Camille, Hodson, Lodge, Wiggins,
all except for Houdini -- find themselves standing in the middle
of the magnificent glen.

As the girls end their chant, Sir Arthur's eyes flare, he's the
first to see her teasingly peeking out from inside a cluster of
pink roses. About five inches tall, sheathed in a translucent
gown of the finest spider silk. Delicate but not fragile. Pretty
beyond rendering. And wings, soft gossamer wings, seemingly more
for adornment than the toil of flying.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing the story)
                That's when we first saw the playful
                Rosamund...

A collective gasp as others see her. Rosamund runs (though her
little feet never touch ground) up to the fairie ring twirling a
rosebud over her head, opening and closing it like an umbrella.
She tosses it inside the ring, looks back, vibrates her wings
which glow bright, casting florescent streaks of fantasy colors
into the air surrounding her.

Tiny laughter from the perimeter. Then other fairies appear, in
all shapes and sexes, each distinctly different from the other.
(Introductions as they appear...)

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                Then came the others... Hannah,
                Lady Dorothy: Princess Rebecca and
                her handsome beau, William Travis;
                Sir Henry and Capt'n James; Sweet
                Sydney, the twins Petal and Trick;
                little Tora...
The fairies emerge, each carrying a different flower which they
toss into the ring. They circle around the ring and hold hands.

SOFT PIPE MUSIC begins, a variation of an Irish melody skillfully
played. From out of the grass marches a quite different creature;
taller, stouter, without wings. He's playing the tune on a little
bagpipe-type instrument.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                And of course our musical friend,
                the gnome, Mr. Bandylegs...

The fairies start to twist and hop around the ring, similar to
the dance the girls performed. Then singularly, and in pairs
they enter the ring and revel uncontrollably in the flowers.
                                                              85.


Polly's hand is shaking.     Artie takes it in his.

Houdini sees none of this. His POV as a non-believer is void of
fantasy. What amazes him are the joyous, childlike looks on the
faces of the other adults. Something is happening, something he
is not privy to. He searches, but it's not a party for skeptics.

Everyone's startled by a sudden high pitch sound -- an alarm of
sorts. Behind a bed of wildfire, a glowing aurora of light glows
brighter and brighter.

                          FRANCES
                     (continuing)
                 That's when she called her children
                 home.

The dancing fairies respond and quickly head for the light, each
disappearing into the glen in singular style. The intense light
rises over the flowers revealing the most angelic fairie of all.

                          FRANCES
                     (continuing)
                 Queen Tatiana was the most beautiful
                 of all.

QUEEN TATIANA casts her gaze over the guests, a gaze not without
warning, "do not tread lightly into my world" her eyes say. The
light grows brighter and brighter...too bright for human eyes.
Then just as quickly, the light goes out.

Eyes adjust. The glen is gone.      Everyone is silent, lost in their
own thoughts.

                          SIR ARTHUR

expensive, CHAUFFEUR attended cars parked out front.

Guests begin to stir from their numbed silence. Sir Arthur stands
for a moment, as if to say something, then quietly sits back down.
Sir Oliver lights a pipe. Camille, takes down her hair, running
her fingers through it. The clairvoyant Hodson whispers to a
confused Wiggins. Polly and Artie hold hands. Houdini strolls
the perimeter of the room observing the after effects.
                                                             86.


Elsie and Frances sit by the fire.   Frances seems particularly
exhausted by the ordeal.

Sir Arthur stands again. Expectant eyes shift up on this huge
bear of a man. Sir Arthur strokes his moustache, then...

                          SIR ARTHUR
                 War is a beast that consumes our
                 young without remorse, prompting us
                 to search for answers in places only
                 our hearts can understand.
                     (crossing room)
                 Many of us here lost loved ones. My
                 dear son, Kingsley; Sir Oliver, your

Sir Arthur reaches down and touches Polly's hand.

                      Elsie and Frances)
                 But what I now know, what I've learned
                 here this day by the grace of these
                 two extraordinary children, is that
                 our sons are at peace in a world far
                 more benevolent than our own. And
                 until that time when we are reunited,
                 we must honor them, not with the
                 pain of loss...but with the joy of
                 memory.

Polly raises her handkerchief to her lips. Artie comforts her.
Sir Arthur melts his massive bulk before Elsie and Frances.

Houdini glances out the side window at Elsie, Frances, Polly and
Artie waving goodbye from the cottage door. Pats his friends
knee.

Artie closes the door, turns back into the parlor, surprised to
see Lord Wiggins sitting in a chair, eyes transfixed by the fire.
Artie motions for the girls to go upstairs.

                           ARTIE
                     (restrained relief)
                 Yes, Sir.


INT.   JOSEPH'S ROOM - SAME TIME                                       109
Polly moves through the room -- touching his chair, smelling his
pillow -- remembering.

                          ARTIE (O.S.)
                     (concern)
                 Polly?

Artie, exhausted, still damp from the rain, pushes in through the
door. Polly offers him a small smile; pained, but resigned, which
relaxes Artie a bit.

The room closes in on Artie as a rush of memories envelope him.
He sits back on the bed, drinking in the room and the events of
the day.
                                                           88.


                          ARTIE
                     (continuing)
                 Quite a day...quite-a-day...

Artie looks at Polly, who returns his gaze, perhaps for the first
time since Joseph died.

                          ARTIE
                     (continuing; still being
                      the rock)
                 You holdin' up all right?

Polly nods, looks down into her lap. Her hand opens like a flower,
revealing a small, blurry snapshot of a skinny little boy in the
glen.

Artie chokes on a breath. His face pinches, his eyes cloud over
as the damn that been holding back his grief, breaks, and he starts
to sob. Polly, for the moment the strong one, draws him near.
Someone stirs in the darkness outside the door.


INT.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE JOSEPH'S ROOM - SAME TIME                      110

Frances is a silent witness.


INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - MORNING                                        111

Frances, with an unfamiliar sadness, is sitting in front of her
opened steamer trunk. Her dresses and things are noticeably
missing. She's removing her family photos from around the mirror
and tossing them into the bottom drawer of Elsie's dresser.

Elsie enters the room.   Curiously watches Frances.

                          ELSIE
                 Frances, what are you doing...?
                 Please don't do that.

                          FRANCES
                     (near tears)
                 I'm tired of photographs.

The faint sound of a ringing bell seeps into the room. The girls
hear it at the same time. Frances has been fooled before. Elsie
moves to the window.

                          ELSIE
                 Frances...

                          MR. TELLER (O.S.)
                     (distant, calling)
                 Frances! Frances Griffiths!
                                                            89.


Frances rushes to the window, sees Mr. Teller approaching on his
bike, then bolts for the door.


EXT.   COTTAGE - MORNING                                               112

Frances scrambles out, nearly knocking Mr. Teller off his bike.
He hands her a small package that looks like it's gone through
hell.

                          MR. TELLER
                 Hope it's what y've been expectin'.

Frances gazes over the worn, beaten package.   Elsie steps up behind
her. Artie and Polly appear at the door.

In a blaze, Frances rips open the package, removes a small, fancy
box. Inside, is a tiny, porcelain Limoges bottle. Stunned, she
drops the empty package.

                          ELSIE
                 What is it?

                          FRANCES
                     (choking up)
                 French perfume...

The girls run inside. Artie picks up the package, looks it over.
Addresses are crossed out, postal stamps, stickers, stains...
It's a mess.

                           MR. TELLER
                 God only knows how long it's been in
                 the post.

                          POLLY
                     (to Artie)
                 You think he might be...?
A foreboding look passes between Artie and Polly. Artie casts a
pained glance up toward the girl's attic bedroom window.


INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - DAY                                             113

Close on the opened perfume box, and a handwritten note wedged in
its top: "I always keep my promises, Happy Christmas, Daddy."

                          FRANCES (O.S.)
                 It was supposed to be for Christmas.

Frances is staring down into the box. She and Elsie are sitting
scrunched up in the well of the dormer window. Elsie reads the
uncertainty on Frances' face.
                                                             90.

                 That seems a long time ago -- good
                 thing it didn't break.

Frances opens the perfume, dabs some on her wrist, then
smells...heavenly. She glances up at Elsie whose eyes are
transfixed on the glen. Frances gently reaches over and dabs
perfume behind Elsie's ears.

                          FRANCES
                     (soothing, as she dabs)
                 They'll come back someday.

                          ELSIE
                     (regretful sigh)
                 After what we did to them, I'm not
                 so sure.

                          FRANCES
                 We weren't so bad, really.    The photos
                 made people happy.

                          ELSIE
                 I'm just glad it's over.


INT.   SIR ARTHUR'S PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - SOME WEEKS LATER           114

A loud SLAP! as a manuscript is slammed down on an old wood desk.

                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                     (outraged)
                 Fairies again!

Sir Arthur's editor, SIMON HANDLEY looks up at Sir Arthur over
his reading glasses. We see the title of the manuscript, "The
Coming of the Fairies, by Arthur Conan Doyle."
                          HANDLEY
                     (continuing)
                 Doyle, you can't be serious!

                          HANDLEY
                 Be reasonable, now, a book?!

                          SIR ARTHUR
                 I should like to see it published as
                 soon as possible, Mr. Handley.

Sir Arthur lights a pipe.
                                                           91.


                          HANDLEY

                 To the core.

Handley scratches his chin, thinking of angles...

                 Actually, the public did rally behind

EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - DAY                                        115

Autumn. The glen is bathed in a golden hue. Leaves cover the
ground. Elsie is sitting alone on the tree bridge, swinging her
legs and watching leaves float past in the stream.

                          POLLY (O.S.)
                 It is beautiful, isn't it.

Elsie turns, surprised to see her mother entering the glen.

                          ELSIE
                 Mum...

Polly breathes deeply, drinks in the surroundings.

                          POLLY
                 I can see why you children love it
                 so.
                     (points next to Elsie)
                 May I?

Elsie smiles, scoots over half a cheek. Polly balances out on
the bridge, sits next to Elsie on a well worn spot. She notices
splatters of paint on the log. She touches each one individually.

                          POLLY
                     (continuing)
                 Joseph?

Elsie nods contemplatively.

                          POLLY
                     (continuing)
                 He was quite the artist, your brother.
                                                             92.

                    (taking in the glen)
                He must have missed coming down here.

Elsie flings a piece of bark into the stream.

                         ELSIE
                Why'd you make him stop?

Pondering the question, Polly peels a scab of bark off the tree
and flings into the stream.

                         POLLY
                It was his time. Other boys his age
                were showing interest in girls and
                the war. Joseph refused to let go
                of the fairies. We couldn't allow
                it any more. It was his time to
                grow up.

Polly touches a red paint splatter as a pang of regret shoots
through her.

                         POLLY
                    (continuing; deep regret)
                It's a painful thing to be
                disappointed in one's children.

Elsie mistakenly thinks this is meant for her.    She looks away.

                         ARTIE (O.S.)
                    (distant)
                Polly! Elsie!

Artie and Frances race down the slope into the glen. Frances
grabs the back of Artie's shirt to keep up. Artie is waving a
piece of paper over his head.
                         ARTIE
                    (continuing, out of breath)
                Polly! London!

Artie and Frances splash into the stream before Polly and Elsie.
They take a second to catch their breath.

                         POLLY
                Artie, what are you talking about?

                         ARTIE
                London, Polly, we're goin' t'London!

                         FRANCES

                                                           93.


                          ELSIE
                 Why?

Artie hands the telegram to Polly.

                          ARTIE
                 He's written a book about t'fairies.
                 He wants us there for its debut.

Elsie covers her face with in frustration.


INT.   FIRST CLASS TRAIN CAR - MOVING - DAY                         116

Elsie lifts her face from her hands and stares out the window at
the passing countryside. Frances is sitting beside her. Both
girls are wearing their best, Elsie in her pink dress.

                          ELSIE
                     (angry)
                 It's supposed to be over, Frances.

                          ELSIE
                 How can you be so selfish.   We made
                 a promise, remember?

                          FRANCES
                 Of course I remember. But your mum
                 is better. And that's all we were
                 trying to do.

Frances glances back to Polly, who has shed her black dress for a
beautiful yellow one. She looks radiant sitting next to the proud
Artie.
                          FRANCES
                     (continuing)
                 Whatever else happened wasn't our

Frances sits back, arms folded.       After a beat.

                       (continuing)

Polly steps up in the aisle before the girls.         She's stunning in
her yellow dress. She smiles.

                   Elsie has something to tell you.

The moment of truth. Elsie stares up at her mother, as beautiful
as she's ever seen her.

Polly moves off.    Elsie glares at Frances.

                   You don't know everything, Frances
                   Griffiths. You don't know for certain
                   when a fairie curse will strike.

Elsie turns to look out the window. Frances stares down at the
skirt of Elsie's dress, her gaze lingering on the mended hole.

Elsie, Frances, Polly and Artie emerge onto the bustling streets

toward a shot of rye set up on the bar in front of him. It's no
small effort.

Ferret grabs the newspaper from Smiley and looks over the article.

                          FERRET
                     (gets idea)
                 T'family's in London, eh?

As Rollo just about grabs his shot, Ferret reaches in and swipes
it away. Aghast, Rollo watches Ferret down his shot and head for
the door.
                          ROLLO
                 Y'er a dirty thief, John Ferret!

                          FERRET
                 All in the name of truth...


EXT./INT.   LONDON MONTAGE - DAY                                     119

Begin MONTAGE as the girls, Artie, Polly, Sir Arthur and Gardner
hit the town. MUSIC SCORED over following:

The party is on the open air top deck. The press corp crowds
around the demonstrative Frances, while Elsie avoids the lime
light. Frances gawks -- at Westminster Cathedral, Big Ben, Tower
Bridge, Trafalgar Square...


...CHARRING CROSS BOOKSHOP - DAY                                    120

In the window a display of Sir Arthur's book, "Coming of the
Fairies." including photos of Elsie and Frances.

Inside, a Highbrow party atmosphere. Frances is the darling of
the press. Elsie watches from behind a bookcase, purposely
avoiding the attention.


INT. ST. THOMAS HOSPITAL - CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY                    121

Elsie and Frances are escorted up the aisle of the ward by a team
of doctors and dignitaries, including Sir Arthur and Gardner.
CHILDREN, in wheelchairs, on crutches, bedridden -- reach out to
them. The press corp continues to favor Frances.

END MONTAGE as a YOUNG BOY in traction reaches out to Frances,
who takes his hand. His name, TOBY, is taped to the pocket of
his hospital gown. The press crowds around. Elsie looks on.

                         TOBY
                Miss...?   Could you please ask your
                fairies to help me get well?

                         FRANCES
                I'll sure try.

                            TOBY
                You will?     Thank you ever so much.

The press eats this up. Frances moves off, carrying the press in
her wake. Elsie looks back at Toby with sympathetic eyes. She
moves up to him.

                         ELSIE
                    (not easy)
                Actually, Toby...fairies can't help
                you get well.

Toby is crestfallen.   Polly notices Elsie talking to him.

                         ELSIE
                    (continuing)

                   I have an angel?

                            ELSIE
                   Well, I believe you do. We all do.
                   They help us get through the worst
                   times.

Toby beams.   Elsie turns, surprised to find Polly standing behind
her.

                   That was nice. I think you did some
                   good there. I'm so proud of you.

Their eyes lock.    The connection is electric.

                            POLLY
                       (continuing; whispers)

                               ELSIE
                   For what?

Polly takes Elsie's arm and leads her off.

                            POLLY

EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - NIGHT                                       122
A lantern approaches in the darkness. It's Ferret. He finds the
twig doll house in the heather. Kicks it with disdain.


INT.   HIPPODROME THEATER - LONDON - NIGHT                           123

Houdini is on stage in the process of swallowing a ball of string
and a handful of straight pins. The packed audience is prim and
formally attired. The girls, Artie, Polly, Sir Arthur and Mr.
Gardner are front row center, guests of honor.

Elsie and Frances squirm in their seats as Houdini reaches into
his mouth and begins tugging out the line of string. One by one,
the straight pins emerge, neatly tied to the string. Houdini
finishes with a flourish and takes his bow. The girls lead the
enthusiastic applause.
                                                              98.


Houdini claps his hands twice and two leggy FEMALE ASSISTANTS
wheel out his famous Chinese Water tank.

Ferret snakes up to the back of the house. Tries the door. It's
locked. He looks around to see if the coast is clear, then jimmies
open a window and crawls in.

Houdini is hoisted upside down into the air and positioned over
the water tank. The audience holds their breath as he's slowly
lowered into the water. The assistants bolt the top shut.
Houdini, his eyes like bubbles, struggles to free himself.

Houdini's struggle continues. We see him worm a finger, then a
hand out from the jacket. The girls, the audience, everyone is
ready to burst.

Houdini sheds the straight jacket, frantically he reaches for the
lock around his feet. In a close shot we discover Houdini's
secret, shielded from the audience, he cleverly removes a small
piece of wire from his mouth and starts working the lock.

The audience goes crazy with applause. Elsie suddenly grabs her
stomach with a pained expression.

what he's found, but from his look of triumph, we know it's what
he's been looking for.

Plush accommodations overflowing with flowers and WELL WISHERS.
REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS crowd around Houdini and the girls.
Elsie's holding her aching stomach. Polly steps up.

INT. LONDON'S ST. JAMES HOTEL - ROYAL SUITE - ELSIE'S BEDROOM -   136
NIGHT
The "Royal Suite" and all that implies -- antiques, fine art,
endless gold leaf. Elsie looks like a lonely doll sitting up in
the middle of a huge canopy bed, a thermometer sticking out of
her mouth. Polly reaches in and pulls it out. Frowns.

                You do have a fever.   No more sweets

Polly exits.

Frances climbs up on the bed next to Elsie, who remains silent.

                          FRANCES
                 You're not having the least bit of

INT.   ROYAL SUITE - ELSIE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT                    137

Elsie's sleeping fitfully, mumbling.

The bedroom window is suddenly blown open by a gust of wind. The
curtains ripple and lift, revealing an eerie blue light steadily
approaching.

Elsie sits up, grasping for breath. She turns to the window.
The blue light floods into the room, depositing the ghostly vision
of her brother JOSEPH, in military uniform, at her bedside.

Elsie screams, but without sound. Joseph takes her hand, and as
he does, the fear washes from her face. He stares at her lovingly,
then...

                 Never stop believing, Elsie...

Joseph moves back to the window where he's absorbed by the intense
blue light. Elsie bounds out of bed, leans out the window.

Elsie's POV out the window is of the glen bathed in a powerful
white back light. Joseph is being led to the light by the fairies.

Elsie's eyes open with a start.     Someone stirs in the shadows.

                          ELSIE

Polly steps out from the darkness, sits on the bed beside Elsie.

                 Shhh, Joseph's not here...

Polly climbs in under the covers next to Elsie, who's still
shivering from her dream. Elsie melts under her mother's warm
embrace.

makes its way through the gates.

INT.   BUCKINGHAM PALACE - ROYAL MEETING ROOM - DAY                    139

The girls and their party are escorted into a cavernous room with
a roaring fire and big, fancy furniture. The girls crawl up onto
a massive settee. Their little feet dangle over the edge,
wiggling. Their eyes are searchlights fanning the coffered
ceiling, the marble statuary, the wall size tapestries... Elsie
reaches for Frances' hand.

Then behind them, footsteps.   Sure and crisp.    Sir Arthur stands.

                          SIR ARTHUR
                 Your Majesty...

The girls turn and find themselves staring face level into the
sovereign's dress coat, decorated with medals, ribbons and shiny
brass buttons. Above all this, KING GEORGE V's bearded face.

                         KING GEORGE
                So good to see you, Sir Arthur.

The girls heads fall back as they look up at the two giant men
exchanging greetings.

                         SIR ARTHUR
                Your Majesty... May I introduce Mr.

hand harder.

                Ah, the fairie girls. That is what
                my daughter calls you.

Footsteps again, no less sure, only this time lighter, delicate,
profoundly graceful.

Princess Mary leads the girls out, followed by a contingent of
guards. Elsie glances back at her mother, who smiles and offers
a small wave of her fingers. King George sits, Sir Arthur and
the Wright's follow.

                         KING GEORGE
                Of course, the crown cannot endorse

                deny that the very notion has captured
                the imagination of the people.
                                                            104.


EXT.   BUCKINGHAM PALACE - ROYAL GARDEN - DAY                         140

Princess Mary leads the girls through a meticulously attended
garden of roses and all sorts of beautiful flowers.

                          PRINCESS MARY
                     (intensely curious)
                 What kind of shoes did they wear?
                 Were their dresses made of chiffon
                 or silk? Do they speak English or
                 French...?

Frances and Elsie exchange sideways glances and giggle.


INT.   BUCKINGHAM PALACE - PRESS ROOM - LATER                         141

The din of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS clamoring for position.
Gardner stands smugly in the wings.

A ROYAL AIDE announces.

                          ROYAL AIDE
                 His Royal Highness, King George V,
                 Princess Mary and honored guest...

King George, followed by Princess Mary and the girls, Sir Arthur,
Polly and Artie. The press goes wild. Flashes explode.

Elsie absorbs it all -- Princess Mary, Sir Arthur, Gardner, her
mother's smile, Buckingham Palace, then dear Frances. A joy is
building inside of her...

                          FERRET (O.S.)
                     (shouting)
                 Your Majesty! I know the truth about
                 those fairie photographs!
The voice echoes through the room. The girls see Ferret.    Frances
grabs Elsie's hand. They look at each other.

                          ELSIE/FRANCES
                     (frightened whispers)
                 The fairie's curse!

The room quiets, shocked by Ferret's accusation.

                          ROYAL AIDE
                     (to Ferret)
                 Sir, the King is not taking questions
                 today.

Ferret pushes his way up to the front of the crowd.   GUARDS
surround him.
                                                          105.


                          FERRET
                 The King must know the truth.

                          KING GEORGE
                 And you, Sir, are its bearer.

Ferret waves Joseph's folder over his head.

                          FERRET
                 I am, Your Majesty.

The King gestures to his aide, who takes the folder from Ferret --
"glen drawings" written on its cover. He hands it to the King
who examines its contents without emotion.

Polly steps protectively in front of Elsie and Frances, whose
eyes are glued to their shoes.

The King looks sternly down at Ferret.

                          KING GEORGE
                 Sir, there is no truth here for me.

The King turns back to the girls, who are terrified, melded into
each other like siamese twins.

                          KING GEORGE
                     (continuing)
                 These girls have given the people
                 something to believe in again. And
                 by God, no country needs that more
                 today than England!

King George gestures. On cue, a guard flings open a window.
Outside, the adoring crowd CHEERS.

                          KING GEORGE
                     (continuing, off cheers)
                 The people have spoken!

Ferret is carried off like a blathering idiot.

King George casts a stern look at the girls, then hands the folder
over to Polly. Elsie pleads forgiveness with her eyes.


INT.   BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - LATER                          142

The entourage is being escorted through the massive corridor lined
with priceless art.

Elsie and Frances stumble behind Polly, who stops in front of a
wall size fireplace. The others continue on, it's just Polly and
the girls.
                                                          106.


Polly opens the folder, takes in its contents (which we do not
yet see.)

                          ELSIE
                 I'm so sorry, Mum. We had to do it
                 this way so you could see them.
                     (pleading)
                 But they are real...they are.

Polly turns to Elsie, a beat, then she takes her in her arms.

                          POLLY
                 I believe you.

Holding on to Elsie, Polly tosses the folder into the fire.

Close on the folder as it burns and curls open, revealing the
girl's artifice...we see sheets of Joseph's drawings, fairie
drawings, some of which have been cut out and used in the photos.

Frances watches, unhugged, a hollow feeling of loss spreading
through her small body...


EXT.   VICTORIA STATION - DAY                                         143

The North train stands ready for departure. The girls wave goodbyes
to Sir Arthur, Gardner and Houdini.


INT.   TRAIN - FIRST CLASS CAR - MOVING - DAY                         144

Exhausted, Elsie is asleep between Polly and Artie. Frances sits
alone across the aisle, staring longingly out the window.


INT.   COTTAGE - JOSEPH'S ROOM - NIGHT                                145
Polly, not in black, is packing Joseph's things into a box,
lingering over each piece before placing it in. Elsie stops
outside the door.

                          ELSIE
                 Mum?

                          POLLY
                 Elsie, come in.

Elsie curiously watches Polly pack.

                          ELSIE
                 What are you doing?
                                                             107.


                          POLLY
                 I don't think Joseph would mind it
                 terribly if you moved in.

                            ELSIE
                 Really??

Elsie hugs her mum. A bright flash of light explodes into the
room. Artie is at the door, with his camera and a smoking flash.
He's wearing the knitted red sweater.

                          ARTIE
                 Ah, it's good t'see m'girls together.

Artie moves in on the hug -- a family reunited.


INT.   HALLWAY OUTSIDE JOSEPH'S ROOM - SAME TIME                      146

Cloaked by the shadows of the hall, little Frances watches the
scene through large, sad eyes.


INT.   ATTIC BEDROOM - NIGHT                                          147

Elsie is in a happy half sleep.     She turns to look at Frances,
who's not in her bed.

                          ELSIE
                 Frances...?

Crossing to the door Elsie looks out the window and sees Frances
running toward the glen, her nightgown luminous in the moonlight.


EXT.   COTTINGLEY GLEN - NIGHT                                        148

Under the light of the moon, a barefoot Elsie searches for Frances.
She finds her kneeling inside the shriveled fairie ring. Pieces
of the shattered fairie palace are scattered around.

                          ELSIE
                 Frances, what's the matter?

                          FRANCES
                 You were right, Elsie, this is all
                 my fault, they're not coming back...
                 And neither is my daddy.

                          ELSIE
                 Frances, don't say that.

                          FRANCES
                 I know what missing means.
                                                          108.


Frances takes in the stillness of the glen.

                         FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                Maybe we just imagined the fairies
                after all. Maybe they were just
                photographs.

                         ELSIE
                You know that's not true.
                    (pointing at fairie ring)
                You wouldn't be here now if you didn't
                still believe.

Elsie reaches out her hands to Frances.

                         ELSIE
                    (continuing)
                C'mon, let's call them back.

                         FRANCES
                I can't...

                         ELSIE
                Together we can. They'll come back
                if we believe with all our might.

                         FRANCES
                    (defiant)
                What makes you so sure?

Elsie stares down at Frances for a beat, the smiles.

                         ELSIE
                You.
                    (extends her hands)
                Please...
Slowly Frances takes her hands. The girls begin the delicate
circular dance around the wilted fairie ring.

                         ELSIE/FRANCES
                Come out from your fairie bower...
                Come upon this golden hour... Come
                to us we beg you please... Fairies
                dancing on the breeze...
                    (repeat)

As they pick up speed and volume... We see the circle of
toadstools magically come back to life. Throughout the glen,
glimmers of light emerge -- from flowers, from the stream, up
from the ground... Soon the glen is filled with light, like a
great aurora.
                                                          109.


The fairies are back! Rosamund, Princess Rebecca, William Travis,
Sir Henry, Capt'n James, Sweet Sydney, Little Tora, Lady Dorothy,
Hannah, Trick, Petal -- all of them. They fly around the girls
showering them with flower petals and fairie glitter. Elsie and
Frances, through tears of joy, laugh and howl and dance.

                         ELSIE/FRANCES
                    (continuing)
                ...come to us we beg you please...
                fairies dancing on the breeze...

Camera rises up above the glen and the countryside. Below, in
the distance, a lone SOLDIER wearily walks up a road lugging a
large duffel bag. He looks across a pasture toward a strange
glow lighting up the horizon. As if drawn, he leaves the road,
walking faster and faster toward it, until he breaks out into a
run toward the light.

As we slowly FADE OUT, we hear a joyous howl...

                         FRANCES (O.S.)
                Daddy!

                                                         FADE OUT:
