INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

FADE IN:

On a RINGING phone.    A hand reaches for it.

                       SHERRIE
           Hello?

A young girl of 17. Sweet. Innocent in that scrubbed clean
way. Looks like a virgin. Probably not.

                     MAN'S VOICE
               (from phone)
           Hello.

                       SHERRIE
           Yes?

                     MAN'S VOICE
           Who is this?

                     SHERRIE
           Who are you calling?

                     MAN'S VOICE
           Who am I speaking to?

                     SHERRIE
           Wrong number.

CLICK.   Sherrie hangs up.    Not very polite about it.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Sherrie joins Trudie, 16, a sexy, pretty. Tells it like it
is. Trudie is snacking on chips while TEXTING on her
SIDEKICK. Two friends hanging out.

                     TRUDIE
           Who was that?

                       SHERRIE
           Nobody.    Are you making popcorn?

                     TRUDIE
           No, did you pick a movie?

                     SHERRIE
           We're going scary.    SAW 4.

Sherrie searches the cabinets and fridge for food.
                                                           2


                    TRUDIE
          I saw it in the theater. It sucks.
          And it's not scary -- it's gross.
          I hate that torture porn shit.

                    SHERRIE
          How do you really feel? I like
          Jigsaw. He kills people very
          creatively.

                    TRUDIE
          But you don't give a shit who dies.
          There's no character development.
          Just body parts ripping and blood
          spewing. Blaaaah.

                    SHERRIE
          Who do you keep texting?

                    TRUDIE
          I have a Facebook stalker.   He
          keeps leaving me messages.

                       SHERRIE
          Like what?

                    TRUDIE
          Just stuff. Like, "Hey, what's up.
          You're hot. I wanna kill you."

                    SHERRIE
          Delete him.

                     TRUDIE
          I did.   He hacked his way back in.

                    SHERRIE
          Report him.

                    TRUDIE
          He's really hot. Wanna see?

Sherrie joins Trudie as she pulls up a profile.   A glimpse of
a shirtless young hottie.

                    SHERRIE
          That's Channing Tatum.

It's hard to make out on the small screen.

                       TRUDIE
          It is not?     Is it?
                                                               3


                    SHERRIE
          From his Abercrombie days.        You're
          being punked.

The PHONE RINGS again.   Sherrie goes for the kitchen phone.

                    SHERRIE (CONT'D)
              (into phone)
          Hello?

                    MAN'S VOICE
              (from phone)
          Who is this?

                    SHERRIE
          The more impatient version of the
          person you just spoke to.

                    MAN'S VOICE
          I'm sorry. You don't have to be a
          bitch about it.

                    SHERRIE
          Of course I don't.     Eat me.

Annoyed, Sherrie starts to hang up when--

                    MAN'S VOICE
          You hang up on me and I'll cut into
          your neck until I feel bone.

Sherrie stops in her tracks.     Stunned.    Trudie looks at her.

                     TRUDIE
              (to Sherrie)
          Who is it?

Sherrie's not sure what to think.    So she holds out the
phone.

                    SHERRIE
          It's for you.

Trudie takes it.   Hesitantly.

                     TRUDIE
          Hello?

                    MAN'S VOICE
          Who is this?

                    TRUDIE
              (into phone)
          Trudie. Who is this?
                                                         4


                    MAN'S VOICE
          This is the last person you're ever
          going to see alive.

Trudie looks to Sherrie.   WTF?

                    TRUDIE
              (into phone)
          What?

                    SHERRIE
          It's a prank. Hang up.

Trudie hangs up.

                    TRUDIE
          Why'd you hand the phone to me?

                    SHERRIE
          You're the one with the stalker.

                    TRUDIE
          Are the doors locked?

                    SHERRIE
          Don't freak out.

The phone RINGS again.   They stare at each other.

                    TRUDIE
          Let it ring.

Beat. The RINGING stops. They look relieved. Then,
Trudie's SIDEKICK buzzes on the kitchen counter. She picks
it up. Reads.

                    TRUDIE (CONT'D)
              (reading)
          It's from stalker boy.
              (holds it up)
          "Answer the phone."

                    SHERRIE
          Oh for god's sake. It's a joke,
          Trudie. I bet it's Lexi or Karen.

Trudie takes off for the living room.

                    SHERRIE (CONT'D)
          Where are you going?

                    TRUDIE
          To make sure the front door is
          locked.
                                                            5


Sherrie follows her.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

They come to the front door. Trudie checks the locks as
Sherrie watches. Trudie turns back to Sherrie when...

The DOORBELL RINGS. They both SCREAM. Staring at the front
door. Sherrie starts for it. Trudie stops her.

                    TRUDIE
          Don't answer it.

                    SHERRIE
          It's a joke, Trudie. Someone made
          a dummy profile and now they're
          trying to scare you.

                     TRUDIE
              (calling out)
          Who is it?
              (no answer)
          I said -- who is it?
              (still no answer)
          Let's call the cops.

Just then, Trudie's SIDEKICK BUZZES with a message.   Trudie
jumps out of her skin. She looks at it, reading.

                    TRUDIE (CONT'D)
          "I dare you to open the door."

Trudie's officially terrified. Sherrie is not quite sold.
She's contemplating opening the door.

                    TRUDIE (CONT'D)
          No, Sherrie. Don't.

                    SHERRIE
          Who emails you from the front
          porch?

Trudie shrugs.   Has no idea.

                    SHERRIE (CONT'D)
          One of our asshole friends, that's
          who. I bet it's Karen and Lexi.

Sherrie starts for the door.    Trudie stops her.

                    TRUDIE
          No, don't, I'm scared.
                    SHERRIE
          Or Barry or Lance. It could be
          anyone we know. Lisa, Bailey,
          Wayne, or the hopeful long shot --
          Channing Tatum.

Sherrie goes to the front door -- unlocks it. Trudie steps
back, shaking. As the door rips open revealing--

AN EMPTY DOORWAY.   No one's there.   Sherrie steps outside
onto the porch.

Trudie watches her as she looks around.    She shrugs, turning
back to Trudie.

                    SHERRIE (CONT'D)
          There's no one out here.

Sherrie stands in the doorway, facing Trudie -- her back
exposed to the outside. Just then...

Trudie's SIDEKICK BUZZES in her hands.    Trudie looks, opens
it up.

                    SHERRIE (CONT'D)
          What does it say?

Trudie reads her phone.

                    TRUDIE
          It says, "I'm not outside.     I'm
          right behind..."

TRUDIE has time to register this.     She spins around to see a--

A GHOST FACE KILLER SPRINGS FROM THE DARKNESS -- LUNGING AT
HER. KNIFE IN THE AIR.

Sherrie SCREAMS for her friend, watching as the GHOST FACE
stabs Trudie. The knife penetrates deep. Upon its
withdrawl, Trudie drops instantly. Dead.

Sherrie stands frozen. Until the GHOST FACE turns his
attention to her. That's all it takes for Sherrie to flee.

She spins around.   Starts out the front door when--

ANOTHER GHOST FACE KILLER APPEARS on the porch, completely
surprising her.

Sherrie starts to SCREAM but the GHOST FACE is too fast.      A
flash of silver.

A KNIFE SLICES SHERRIE'S THROAT.    STIFLING HER SCREAM.
                                                               7


She stands there a moment, clutching her neck as the blood
pours from it. Unable to scream. A look of confusion and
helplessness.

A beat. As she GURGLES for air.      Then -- out of nowhere --
A MADDENING SCREAM.

CUT TO BLACK.   SUPERIMPOSE TITLE:

                             STAB 6
                    GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          You're fucking kidding me.

Suddenly, the CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL--

INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

A TV SCREEN -- STAB 6 -- MAIN TITLES

It becomes clear the previous sequence was merely the opening
scene from a movie on television.

As the CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER REVEALING -- TWO TEEN GIRLS
on a couch. In a different living room. In a different
house. They are watching the horror movie STAB 6.

RACHEL and CHLOE, both 17.    Best friends. Rachel grabs the
remote. Shuts off the TV.     She's the more outspoken one.

                    RACHEL
          That was so fucking stupid. Pure
          horse shit. The death of horror.
          Right here. In front of us.

Chloe is more reserved.   She tries to defend it.

                      CHLOE
          I jumped.    It scared me.

                    RACHEL
          A fucking Facebook killer?     You're
          kidding me, right?

                    CHLOE
          It's a few years old. Now, it
          would be twitter. Which would make
          a lot more sense.

Rachel gets up and goes to the kitchen.    Opens the fridge.
                                                               8


                    RACHEL
          A bunch of articulate teenagers sit
          around and deconstruct horror
          movies until a ghost face kills
          them one by one. It's been done to
          death. The whole self-aware, post-
          modern meta-shit is over. Stick a
          fork in 1996 already.

Chloe stays in the living room.    It's an open floor plan so
they can see each other.

                    CHLOE
          I like STAB movies. They're
          scarier. It's not torture porn or
          zombies or aliens or Asian ghost
          girls. There's something real
          about a guy with a knife. Who just
          snaps. It could really happen.

Rachel opens a soda and starts back to the couch where she
plops back down next to Chloe.

                    RACHEL
          I can't do it. These sequels don't
          know when to stop. They just keep
          recycling the same shit. Even the
          opening scene. Some random girl
          gets a call that undoubtedly ends
          in her getting killed. It's all so
          predictable, there's no element of
          surprise, you see everything
          coming...

IN A FLASH, CHLOE PULLS A BUTCHER KNIFE FROM UNDER A PILLOW
AND STABS RACHEL IN THE STOMACH.

Blood spews as Rachel registers surprise.    Shock.   A very
unpredictable moment.

Rachel looks down and stares at the knife in her stomach.
Complete and insidious horror. As her friend Chloe's face
turns maniacal and evil. She pulls the knife out.

                    CHLOE
          Did that surprise you?

Rachel tries to speak, but spits up blood.   Beat.

                    RACHEL
              (barely audible)
          Why....

Chloe stabs her again.   Deeper this time.
                                                              9


                    CHLOE
          Because you talk too much. Now
          shut the fuck up and watch the
          movie.

Rachel's body goes slack. As she sits there. On the couch.
Bleeding to death. Chloe reaches for the remote. And as
Rachel nears death, Chloe HITS PLAY.

A MADDENING SCREAM.    CUT TO BLACK.   MAIN TITLE CARD.   AGAIN.

                            STAB 7
The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING--

INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

A TV SET. The previous scene was also another fake out.
TWO TEEN GIRLS are lounging in a family room of a large
house. JENNY, 16, cute and bouncy, sits up LAUGHING
uncontrollably. She hits PAUSE.

                    JENNY
          Oh God, I love it. I've seen this
          movie five times. It gets me every
          time.

Her friend, MARNIE, 16, brainy, over-achiever.

                    MARNIE
          You're kidding? I don't get it.

                    JENNY
          It's like a TWILIGHT ZONE movie
          within a movie.

                    MARNIE
          I get that. But it's illogical.
          It begs the question. If the
          beginning of STAB 7 is STAB 6?
          What's at the beginning of STAB 6?
          STAB 5? And, if so, what was STAB
          4 about?

Jenny stares at her.

                    JENNY
          You're over-thinking it.

                    MARNIE
          You know what kills me? Somewhere,
          someone thought that was clever.

                    MARNIE (CONT'D)
          There's a reason I don't watch
          these movies.

                    JENNY
          I can't believe you've never seen
          them. We live in Woodsboro.

                    MARNIE
          This has nothing to do with
          Woodsboro. I thought STAB was
          based on true stories.

                    JENNY
          The first three, the trilogy, was
          all about Sidney Prescott and the
          Woodsboro Murders.

                    MARNIE
          You know my mom went to school with
          her--

                    JENNY
          After that, they just kept making
          lame ass sequels. Money.

                    MARNIE
          Do we have to finish it? I know
          it's the anniversary of the
          Woodsboro massacre but I hate
          horror.

Jenny smiles.    Of course, she does.    Just then, she looks to
the hallway.

                    JENNY
          Did you hear that?

                    MARNIE
          I didn't hear anything.

Jenny rises.    Starts towards the hallway.

                      JENNY
          I did.

                    MARNIE
          Don't try and scare me.       I didn't
          hear anything.

                    JENNY
          I'm not trying to scare you.

                    MARNIE
          You do this all the time.
                                                                11


                       JENNY
             No, I don't.

                       MARNIE
             Halloween night? When I walked
             into the kitchen and found you dead
             on the floor with blood everywhere?

                       JENNY
             It was Halloween.    Lighten up.

Jenny moves to the hallway.

                       MARNIE
             Where are you going?

                       JENNY
             I heard something.

Marnie doesn't believe her.       But still...

                       MARNIE
             Are we the only ones here?

Jenny nods.

                       JENNY
             I'm gonna check it out.

                       MARNIE
             I know you're trying to scare me.

                       JENNY
             I swear I'm not.

Jenny takes off for the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT

It's dark.    Jenny moves down it quickly.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - HOUSE

Marnie waits and watches from the living room.        Uneasy.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jenny enters her bedroom.       Simple.   Sweet.   She notices an
open window.

                       MARNIE (O.S.)
             What is it?

Jenny calls out.
                                                               12


                    JENNY
          I left a window open.

IN THE FAMILY ROOM

Marnie hears that.    Calls out.

                    MARNIE
          That was stupid.

IN THE BEDROOM

                    JENNY
          I'm just gonna check it out.

IN THE FAMILY ROOM

Marnie looks around. Goes to the back patio sliding doors.
Checks to make sure they're locked. Just then, the PHONE
RINGS.

                    JENNY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Will you get that?

IN THE BEDROOM

Jenny has a cell phone in her hand.      She's the one who's
calling her own house.

                       JENNY (CONT'D)
          Marnie?

IN THE FAMILY ROOM

Marnie goes to the phone.       Answers it.

                    MARNIE
              (into phone)
          Hello.

                       MAN'S VOICE
          Hello.     Who is this?

                      MARNIE
          Marnie.    Who's this?

                    MAN'S VOICE
          The last person you're ever going
          to see alive.

                       MARNIE
          So lame.

Just then, Jenny BURSTS out LAUGHING.
                                                            13


IN THE BEDROOM

                       JENNY
          I'm sorry.     I had to.

                    MARNIE
              (from phone)
          You bitch. So not funny.

Jenny's very amused with herself.

                    JENNY
          Somebody falls for it every year.

                    MARNIE
          I don't know why you get off on
          this shit -- AAHHHH...

Just then, Marnie SCREAMS. It's a DEADLY SCREAM.    Then, the
line goes dead. Jenny pauses.

                    JENNY
              (into phone)
          Marnie? Marnie?

Jenny looks to the bedroom door. Is she being pranked?      The
SCREAM was very real. She gets up and starts for the
hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT

Jenny moves down the hallway.    Back to the family room.

                       JENNY
          Marnie?

Suddenly, a CRASHING NOISE. Something is upturned. It's
followed by silence. Jenny's looking a little scared.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

Jenny enters to find the room completely dark and empty.    The
back patio doors are wide open. Jenny looks around.

                     JENNY
          Marnie?   Where'd you go?

Jenny circles around the couch. Stumbles over something.
Tripping. She looks down and sees Marnie lying dead on the
floor. Her eyes COLD and LIFELESS.

Jenny SCREAMS. Just then, Marnie sits up LAUGHING
UNCONTROLLABLY. Jenny's been punked. A victim of her own
prank.
                                                                14


                      MARNIE
          Gotchya.    You should have seen your
          face.

Jenny knows she can't be mad.

                    MARNIE (CONT'D)
          I knew you were up to something.
          How'd you do the voice on the
          phone?

                    JENNY
          An app I downloaded.

Marnie gets up.   Jenny helps her.

                    MARNIE
          Can we please stop scaring each
          other now? It's bad enough we've
          had to grow up in this town.

                    JENNY
          Okay, okay, you got me.

They both plop back down on the couch.    The glass doors open
behind them.

                       MARNIE
          What now?

                    JENNY
          Wanna watch something else?

                    MARNIE
          We can watch the rest of the movie.

                    JENNY
          We don't have to.

Neither see the GHOST FACED FIGURE that enters through the
sliding glass doors. It slowly makes its way to the couch.

                       MARNIE
          It's okay.     Now that I'm in the
          mood.

                    JENNY
          Are you sure?

The GHOST FACE moves closer to the couch.      Knife in hand.

                    MARNIE
          Might as well.
                                                            15


Jenny reaches for the remote control.   Just as the GHOST FACE
raises the knife.

                    JENNY
          You like horror movies.   You're not
          fooling anybody.

As Jenny hits PLAY.   The Ghost Face STRIKES with the knife.

THE SCREEN CUTS TO BLACK.   MAIN TITLES.

SCREAM 4
EXT. WOODSBORO - MORNING - ESTABLISHING

The morning sun shines bright over the quaint town of
Woodsboro, California.

Little moments of small town life are all around.   Picture-
perfect. Innocent. Quiet. Then--

SIRENS BLARE as SQUAD CARS tear down Main Street, racing,
speeding... interrupting any hope of a peaceful day.

INT. BEDROOM - RILEY HOUSE - MORNING

A CELL PHONE VIBRATES across the night stand. PULL BACK to
reveal a COUPLE sleeping. Finally, a woman sits up, barely
awake.

It's GALE WEATHERS. Or more accurately, GALE RILEY. Ten
years later. Still strikingly beautiful. But no longer in
that "camera ready" way. She eyes the VIBRATING CELL PHONE.
Looks to her husband. SHOVES HIM.

                    GALE
          You're buzzing.

He doesn't move. It forces Gale to get up. She walks around
to the night stand and takes the cell phone and SILENCES it.

Then, she takes a pillow and SLAMS IT DOWN on the man
sleeping beside her. He leaps up. Huh?

It's DEWEY RILEY. All grown up. Still sweet-faced and
boyish, but experience has seasoned him. Matured him.

Dewey looks around but Gale has already disappeared to the
bathroom.
                                                                16


INT. BATHROOM - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER

Gale is at the sink, brushing her teeth. Dewey enters.
Silence. He goes to the toilet room. His limp is nearly non-
existent. Years of physical therapy.

Dewey pees. Gale spits. More silence.           The unspoken tension
speaks volumes. Finally...

                       DEWEY
             You know what today is, right?

Gale nods.

                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Are you going?

Gale shrugs.    Dewey finishes up.    Flushes.

                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             I think it would be nice if you
             went.

Gale studies herself in the mirror.      She's not the same Gale.
There's something missing.

                       GALE
             I'm sorry about last night.    I
             wasn't in the right space.

Dewey finishes up.    Flushes.

                       DEWEY
             Wanna talk about it?

He turns to his wife.       But she's already left the bathroom.

EXT. RILEY HOUSE - MORNING

A nice two-story house in a nice neighborhood.        Dewey exits
the house and moves to an SUV in the drive.

It has the WOODSBORO SHERIFF'S DECAL on the side. Just then,
a cute SPORTS CAR SPEEDS down the street. ROCK MUSIC
BLARING.

                          DEWEY
             Slow down.

Dewey hops in his jeep.

INT. SPORTS CAR - MORNING

Behind the wheel, KIRBY REED, 17, slows the car.
                                                         17


                     KIRBY
          Shit.   Fuck.

A cute and quirky girl. Was probably a tomboy until a year
ago. Now, she's alternative. Or so she wants you to
believe. Either way -- she's cool.

She rounds the corner.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING

The neighborhood is lined with houses. Nice lawns,
sidewalks, etc. A typical small town neighborhood.

Kirby pulls up and parks in front of an old two-story home.
Full of character. She TOOTS the horn. A few moments and a
young girl emerges.

JILL ROBERTS

A 17 year-old beauty. Pretty in that ingenue way. Smart.
Strong. And a little bit goofy. She makes it sexy. A young
girl full of contradictions -- but instantly likable.
There's not a mean bone in her body.

She hurries to the car and hops in.

INT. KIRBY'S CAR - MORNING

Kirby turns the MUSIC DOWN, launches into a huge discussion.

                    KIRBY
          Okay, don't get upset.   Trevor
          called me last night.

                    JILL
          Why is he calling you?

                    KIRBY
          He knows I have your ear and he
          wants to work it out.
              (looks across the street)
          Where's Olivia?

Kirby HONKS the horn again. Suddenly, OLIVIA MORRIS, 17,
emerges from the house directly across the street from Jill's
house. Olivia is sexy hot. Her walk, style, attitude is
fearless and fierce.

                    JILL
          What did Trevor have to say?
                                                              18


                    KIRBY
          He was fishing. He wants to know
          how upset you are.

                    JILL
          What did you tell him?

                    KIRBY
          Epic grief. Not since Bella fucked
          the werewolf have you known such
          grief.

                    JILL
              (re: Olivia)
          Can we not talk about this now?

The car door opens. Kirby nods.    Gets it.   But as Olivia
crams into the back seat.

                    OLIVIA
          Okay, so Trevor called me last
          night.

Jill throws her hands up.   WTF?   Kirby hits the gas and they
take off.

                    JILL
          He called both of you?    What is he
          thinking?

                    OLIVIA
          He wants to kiss and make up.

                    JILL
          That's not going to happen.

Just then, LADY GAGA'S TELEPHONE song starts playing.   Jill
starts digging in her bag, for her cell phone.

                    OLIVIA
          Not Lady Gaga. For god's sake,
          change your ringtone. Can we hate
          her yet? I so wanna hate her.

Jill eyes her CALLER ID -- JENNY RANDALL

                    JILL
          Why is Jenny Randall calling me?

Both Kirby and Olivia shrug.
                                                  19


                     OLIVIA
           I don't know. I don't like Jenny
           Randall. She threw up on me at
           Tony Marshall's luau.

Jill answers while Olivia explains her hatred.

                     JILL
               (into cell)
           Hello?

                     MAN'S VOICE
           Hello, Jill.

                     KIRBY
               (to Olivia)
           That luau was freshman year.

                     OLIVIA
               (to Kirby)
           I didn't say my anger was rational.

                     JILL
               (into cell)
           Jenny? Is this you?

                     MAN'S VOICE
           What's your favorite scary movie?

                     JILL
           Okay, who is this?

Olivia and Kirby have taken notice of the call.

                     KIRBY
               (to Jill)
           What does she want?

                     JILL
               (into cell)
           Where's Jenny? Who is this?

                     MAN'S VOICE
           I asked you a question. What's
           your favorite scary movie?

                     JILL
           I'm hanging up.

CLICK.   Jill hangs up.   Looks to her friends.
                                                         20


                    JILL (CONT'D)
          That was so weird. I just got a
          prank phone call from Jenny
          Randall.

                    OLIVIA
          Jenny Randall is weird. Her and
          her little Marnie the Carny friend
          are freaks.

                    KIRBY
          It's Massacre Week.    People go
          looney, remember?

They continue on but Jill is clearly bugged by it.

EXT. WOODSBORO - MORNING - ESTABLISHING

The morning sun shines bright over the quaint town of
Woodsboro, California. Little moments of small town life are
all around. Innocent and simple. Picture-perfect.

Except on every lamp post for three blocks -- a GHOST MASK
has been placed over the light fixture. Somebody has played
a prank.

A CITY WORKER stands on a ladder, removing a mask. A female
officer oversees. This is DEPUTY JUDY HICKS, 30's. Cursed
with cute-ness, Hicks plays it serious at all times. She's
over compensating. But it just makes her cuter.

The SHERIFF'S JEEP pulls up.    Dewey slowly gets out,
surveying the stunt.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          Hey, Sheriff. It looks like the
          celebration has begun.

Dewey looks up and down Main Street.    Damn.

                       DEWEY
          Damn kids.     How'd they get up
          there?

                     DEPUTY HICKS
          I'm sorry, you can never get away
          from this.

She smiles, small-town sweet.

                    DEPUTY HICKS (CONT'D)
          Hey, I made some lemon squares.
          They're in my car.
                                                            21


Dewey shies away from the idea.

                    DEWEY
          E-eh, no thanks, Judy.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
              (moving closer)
          Sheriff, you're not cheating on
          your wife if you eat my lemon
          square.

Suddenly, Dewey's RADIO STARTS SQUAWKING.

                     DISPATCHER
              (panicked)
          Sheriff?    Come in, Sheriff.
          Emergency.

Dewey grabs his WALKIE.

                      DEWEY
          Go ahead.

                    DISPATCHER
          You need to get to the Randalls'
          house on Miller's Lane. It's bad,
          Sheriff, real bad.

Dewey looks at Deputy Hicks.   Something's up.

INT. HOME OFFICE - RILEY HOUSE - MORNING

A small home office. A few PLAQUES on the wall. An award or
two. Some framed photos of her days from TOP STORY.

On shelves are stacks of books.    THE WOODSBORO MURDERS.
Based on a True Story.

A glimpse of the latter sequels. COLLEGE TERROR: THE
WOODSBORO HORROR CONTINUES. "Now a Major Motion Picture".
HOLLYWOOD HORROR, The True Story of STAB 3. Etc.

Gale sits at her desk, laptop in front of her.

CLOSE ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN. The words CHAPTER ONE have
been typed a hundred times. Gale takes a sip of coffee.
Taps her fingers. The words don't come.

Finally, Gale pulls up GOOGLE on her SCREEN.     Types in Sidney
Prescott -- NEW RESULTS. She DOUBLE CLICKS.

A NEWS CLIP STREAMS -- from a local San Francisco talk show --
A VIEW FROM THE BAY. Gale presses play. A young FEMALE HOST
addresses the CAMERA.
                                                            22


                     TV HOST
          What inspired you to write about
          your life?

                    SIDNEY PRESCOTT
          I wanted to tell my story. So much
          has been written about me in the
          past...

                    TV HOST
          And, of course, the movies.

                     SIDNEY PRESCOTT
          Yes, with the popularity of the
          STAB films, I've lived my entire
          adult life in this very public role
          of victim.

                    TV HOST
          You survived not one, but three
          horrific nightmares. I saw the
          movies when I was a kid. So scary.

                    SIDNEY PRESCOTT
          I didn't want to be defined by the
          word victim anymore. Writing this
          book was about letting it go. I
          wanted to be free of my past and
          move on once and for all.

Sidney looks and sounds great. Full of resilience and inner
peace. This is a woman who has weathered a great storm.

CLOSE ON GALE as she takes this in.   Affected.

                    TV HOST
          Well, your book put me in tears.
          It's such a beautiful and moving
          story of survival. Everyone should
          read it. Buy it today, people.
          OUT OF THE DARK by Sidney Prescott.

Sidney laughs at the TV Host's shameless plug as the Host
holds up Sid's book. Her picture graces the cover.

                    TV HOST (CONT'D)
          Congratulations on all the great
          reviews. What's next for you?

                    SIDNEY   PRESCOTT
          Between the book   tour and speaking
          engagements, I'm   writing another
          book. So, we'll    see. It's all a
          new adventure.
                                                              23


Sidney smiles. Genuinely happy. Gale CLICKS       -- Sid
disappears. The SCREEN returns to Gale's own      writing. Or
lack of. She stares at the words CHAPTER ONE      over and over
again. Gale hits delete. Then, leaps up and       leaves the
room.

EXT. JENNY RANDALLS' HOUSE - DAY

The idyllic family home is a murder site.       AMBULANCES,
SHERIFF'S CARS, COUNTY CORONERS.

INT. JENNY RANDALL'S HOUSE - DAY

Blood is everywhere.    Streaked along the floor and furniture.

OFFICERS and TECHNICIANS investigate, dusting for prints,
taking photos, bagging evidence.

Dewey stands in the living room.    His face unflinching.     He's
staring at the sofa where--

Jenny and Marnie's bloody bodies have been left.      On display.
Sitting upright, facing the television.

Behind the TV -- written in red are the words, "What's your
favorite scary movie?"

A FORENSIC GUY is there inspecting the wall.      He's doing a
PHOTO-HANDWRITING ANALYSIS.

                    FORENSIC GUY
          Common spray paint. First glance,
          the y's and e's are consistent with
          a right handed male.

                    DEWEY
          Full analysis?

                       FORENSIC GUY
          Few hours.     Lab's waiting on me.

Dewey nods, leaves the room.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

Dewey exits the house. Moves to the edge of the porch.
Alone, he lets out a DEEP SIGH, letting his true emotions
surface. This is hard for him.

Just then, Hicks appears, with TWO DEPUTIES behind her.
PERKINS, 40's, seasoned, and HOSS, 20's, eager.

Dewey spins around -- not letting his emotions show.      He's
the Sheriff. A leader. And he's good at it.
                                                            24


                    DEWEY
          Hoss, you and Perkins, run the
          paint. Check all the locals stores
          and send digital samples to county.

Hoss and Perkins take off.   They're on it.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          Jenny Randall's parents were on a
          ski trip. They thought Jenny was
          sleeping at Marnie's, and Marnie's
          folks thought she was at Jenny's.

                    DEWEY
          Phone records?

                     DEPUTY HICKS
          Both girls had cells and the one
          house phone. We're pulling
          everything.
              (beat)
          You okay, Sheriff?

Dewey turns to Hicks.   In honest candor.

                    DEWEY
          This is about the worst thing that
          could have happened. No, Deputy,
          I'm not okay.

Dewey takes off, leaving Hicks wistful.     She feels his pain.

EXT. WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Red brick and tradition.    Establishing.

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

STUDENTS come and go. ROBBIE MERCER, 16, a lively, wicked
smart cool-nerd, move through the hallway with a FLIP CAMERA.
He stops Olivia at her locker.

                    ROBBIE
          This is HALL PASS WITH ROBBIE,
          coming at ya, POV. I'm here with
          the luscious Olivia-don't-look-at-
          my-breasts-I-have-a-mind--Morris,
          with our topic of the week.

                      OLIVIA
          Which is?    Hurry up.
                                                           25


                    ROBBIE
          For all my horror ho's out there on
          the anniversary of the Woodsboro
          Massacre, I have to ask: What's
          your favorite scary movie?

                    OLIVIA
          That's all you got? Some lame ass
          douche question? "What's your
          favorite scary movie?" Go away,
          closet boy.

Just then, CHARLIE WALKER, 17, messy cute, pops into frame.

                    CHARLIE
          THE EXORCIST, PSYCHO, THE SHINING
          and anything starring Nicole
          Kidman's new face. Owwww.

                    ROBBIE
          Worst scary movie?

                    CHARLIE
          An exhaustive list, Robbie, but
          I'll go with the entire career of
          M. Night Shyamalan.

Just then, Kirby appears, having heard this.

                    KIRBY
          No way, THE SIXTH SENSE is epic.

                    CHARLIE
          Revoked. Now considered a fluke.
          No longer valid.

DOWN THE HALL

Jill is at her locker, finishing up.    She closes it, turns
and runs into...

TREVOR SHELDON, 17, high school jock.   Perfectly handsome.
Perfectly cocky.

                    TREVOR
          Hey, Jill, how ya doing?

Jill barely acknowledges him.   Just an awkward gaze.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Are you ever going to talk to me
          again?
                                                               26


                    JILL
          I hadn't planned on it.

She starts by him, but he cuts her off.

                    TREVOR
          C'mon, you're not being fair. I
          deserve a chance to tell you what
          happened.

                    JILL
          Is it different from the facts?
          Because I know what happened.

Jill start off -- but Trevor blocks her path.    This just
makes her angry.

                    JILL (CONT'D)
          And trying to use Kirby and Olivia
          to help your case -- bad move.

Jill pushes passed him, but he grabs her arm, pulling her
back. It takes her by surprise.

                    TREVOR
          Please, Jill, just talk to me.

Trevor tries to connect to her eyes -- he's pleading.    She
pulls her arm away when--

                    MR. BAKER (O.S.)
          Is everything okay here?

They both turn to find MR. BAKER, 30's, studious, no-nonsense
type, standing behind them. Beat. Jill looks to Trevor.

                    JILL
          Yeah, Mr. Baker, we're good.

Jill turns and walks off.     Trevor cuts eyes at Mr. Baker.

                    MR. BAKER
          Yes, Trevor, what?

                     TREVOR
          Nothing.

Trevor starts off, but this time Mr. Baker blocks his path.
He points in the other direction. Opposite of Jill.

                    MR. BAKER
          You go that way.
                                                             27


Trevor wants to kill this teacher.   But he plays it cool.
Turns and walks away.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - WOODSBORO - DAY

A car pulls up and parks on the street. Gale gets out. She
stares at the small book store on the corner.  She walks
over to it.

EXT. CORNER BOOK STORE - DAY

Gale looks in the window. Sidney's book is the only book on
display. A sign reads MEET SIDNEY PRESCOTT. TODAY ONLY.

INT. BOOK STORE - DAY

A small book and old fashioned book store.   It's crowded.
At capacity. Standing room only.

At a lectern, stands Sidney Prescott, reading from her book.

                    SIDNEY
          I was playing the role of victim.
          The only problem? I never
          auditioned for the role. I never
          asked for the part, but here I was
          playing it to the hilt. Sidney
          Prescott, the real life Scream
          Queen. Celebrity victim. It
          wasn't who I set out to be. It
          wasn't the life I wanted.

In the back, Gale sneaks in, finds a spot. She listens to
Sidney who is full of quiet strength and honesty.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          It was clear my life was in need of
          a rewrite, a re-imagining. I had
          to create a new part to play. So,
          I sat down and began to write a new
          life for myself. A life that
          accepted my past but was no longer
          imprisoned by it.

APPLAUSE from the room. CLOSE ON GALE -- annoyed and
cynical, but oddly moved too.

ON SIDNEY as she greets the PEOPLE who gather around.

A YOUNG WOMAN, REBECCA REED, 20's, a poised and polished
power assistant keeps the wheels moving.
                                                          28


                    REBECCA
          We're going to begin the book
          signing in just a few minutes.

Sidney eyes a woman, mid-forties, KATE ROBERTS, who is
waiting to see her. A big smile and hug.

                    SIDNEY
          Aunt Kate, you made it.    How are
          you? How's Jill?

                    KATE
          We're good. You'll see her at
          dinner. It's been too long.

                    SIDNEY
          Yes, it has. I know since Dad's
          funeral, I've been bad with the
          phone calls.

                    KATE
          You're here now.   We'll have a good
          time tonight.

Rebecca steps in -- not subtle at all.

                    REBECCA
          We gotta keep it moving.

Kate gives a wink, taking off. "Seeya tonight."    As Sidney
turns and comes face to face with Gale. Beat.

Rebecca sees them together. She motions to a PHOTOGRAPHER on
hand. "Get this." The Photographer instantly starts
SNAPPING PHOTOS.

Sidney refuses to let it be awkward.    She hugs Gale.

                    SIDNEY
          It's good to see you, Gale.    I was
          hoping you would come.

                    GALE
          Congratulations, Sidney.     I haven't
          read it yet...

                    SIDNEY
          I know where you can get a copy.

A lingering moment between these two women. Sidney senses
something different about Gale. Just then, Dewey enters and
Sidney lights up.
                                                            29


                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          Dewey!

Gale watches as Sidney races to him, hugging him. Old
friends. Only when they break, does Sidney see Dewey's
serious and worried expression.

Dewey turns to Gale.    Who instantly reads him.   Something is
very, very wrong.

And as if on cue -- COMMOTION ERUPTS all around. PEOPLE
point to the store windows. To the CARS and NEWS VANS seen
approaching.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - WOODSBORO - DAY

The quiet and peaceful town explodes into chaos as the NEWS
MEDIA descends on Main Street. News of the murders is out.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Mr. Baker is in the middle of class.     He writes on the chalk
board with his right hand.

                    MR. BAKER
          Don't forget, projects, are due
          Thursday.

CELL PHONES start to go off in class. VIBRATING everywhere.
STUDENTS start texting each other. The news is spreading.

                    MR. BAKER (CONT'D)
          Somebody wanna share?

Suddenly -- LOUD COMMOTION OUTSIDE. MEDIA TRUCKS are
screeching up. Distracted, the KIDS all look to the windows.
Even Mr. Baker is intrigued.

                    MR. BAKER (CONT'D)
          What the...?

Robbie reads his iphone.

                    ROBBIE
          Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper
          were murdered last night.

The room erupts in SHOCK. Jill turns to Kirby. What? Then,
the BELL RINGS. Quickly, the class empties out. The news
taking everyone's attention. Jill and Kirby start out.

                    KIRBY
          Who called you this morning?
                                                           30


                    JILL
          I don't know. But it came from
          Jenny's phone.

                    KIRBY
          This just got creepy.

They exit the room.

EXT. WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER

On the lawn, TV CAMERAMEN hop out and jockey for position.
TV REPORTERS are quickly starting stand-ups:

                    REPORTER #1
          ...the murdered girls were students
          here, at Woodsboro High School...

          ...as recounted in the bestseller
          by Gale Weathers which launched the
          horror franchise STAB...

A CROWD has gathered to watch. Shocked. Olivia sees Kirby
and Jill exit the school. She races over.

                    OLIVIA
          Do you believe this? Didn't Jenny
          call you this morning?

A look of dread has washed over Jill's face.    And, as if on
cue -- Lady Gaga's TELEPHONE starts playing.    Jill reaches
into her bag and withdraws her phone.

She looks at the CALLER ID. It reads JENNY RANDALL. Jill
nearly GASPS. She looks to her friends. All three of them
are freaking out. Beat. Finally, Jill answers it. Silence.

                    MAN'S VOICE
          Congratulations, Jill.

                    JILL
          Who is this?

                    MAN'S VOICE
          I pick you.

                      JILL
          What?

Kirby grabs Jill's phone, puts it on SPEAKER.

                        OLIVIA
           Who is it?

                     MAN'S VOICE
           I pick you. Don't disappoint me.

CLICK.   The phone goes dead.    The three girls look at each
other.   Stunned. Terrified.

INT. BULL PEN - POLICE STATION - DAY - LATER

A bull pen. Surrounded by offices. A FLURRY of activity.
As DEPUTIES come and go. A chaotic atmosphere.

Gale moves through the bull pen.    She looks around.   Sees
Deputy Hicks.

                     GALE
           Excuse me, Deputy Judy, where's
           Dewey?

Deputy Hicks looks a bit put out. She's not a big fan of
Dewey's wife. But she's professional about it.

                     DEPUTY HICKS
           He's conducting an interview at the
           moment.

                      GALE
           With Sidney Prescott? Are they in
           the conference room? I'll just
           head back.

Gale starts towards the back corridor, but Hicks blocks her.

                     DEPUTY HICKS
           You can't go back there, Gale.

                     GALE
           Since when? I'm married to the
           Sheriff, I'm part of the team.

Gale starts for the hallway again.    But Hicks means business.

                     DEPUTY HICKS
           It's a murder investigation.    I'm
           sorry.

Gale's instinct is to rip Hicks' head off, but lets it go.
Decides to play the "good wife".   But she's annoyed.
                                                         32


INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - POLICE STATION

Jill sits at the conference table with Dewey. Her mother,
Kate, is next to her, supportive. Along with Sidney.

                    DEWEY
          "I pick you."

                    JILL
          That's what he said.

                    KATE
          What does it mean, Dewey?

                    DEWEY
          I can't answer that yet.

                    JILL
          Am I in danger, Sheriff?

                    DEWEY
          To be honest, we don't have enough
          to go on at the moment.

Dewey's eyes meet Sidney. Who appears strong and composed.
She squeezes Jill's hand, reassuringly.

                     SIDNEY
          No, you're not. Because we're not
          going to let anything happen to
          you, Jill.

Jill looks at them, trying to stay calm.

INT. BULL PEN AREA - POLICE STATION - DAY

Gale pours a cup of coffee, waiting, when she sees...

Sidney's assistant, Rebecca, who has taken over a desk. She
has her iPad out, Blackberry in hand, and headset in her ear.

                    REBECCA
              (on phone, compassionate)
          No comment beyond Miss Prescott's
          sincere condolences to the victim's
          family and friends. Thank you.
              (next call)
          This is Rebecca.
              (instantly ecstatic)
          OHMYFUCKINGGOD, Henry. Two girls
          were butchered. Payday. And I was
          so not feeling Woodsboro. I was
          like lame PR move, right? Well,
          FUCKMEWOW. Best. Idea. Ever.
                                                             33


Rebecca spots Gale watching her.   Gives a wave.

                    REBECCA (CONT'D)
              (on the phone)
          Henry, I'll call you back.

Rebecca clicks off.    Goes to Gale.   In awe.

                    REBECCA (CONT'D)
          I have to geek out. I didn't get a
          chance earlier. It's an honor to
          meet you. When I was a kid, it was
          all about, "TOP STORY with Gale
          Weathers." You were my 90's.

                    GALE
          It's Gale Riley now.

                   REBECCA
          Aw. And you gave it all up for
          love. I bow down. That is so...
          not me.

Gale's not sure she likes this girl.    She's not a bitch.
Just talky and self-involved.

                    GALE
          So you're Sidney's assistant?

                    REBECCA
          I'm covering the book tour for
          Random. So, yes, I am assisting
          Sidney, but I wear a lot of hats so
          if you need anything.

Rebecca slides Gale her business card.    Gale takes it.   Hmm.

                    REBECCA (CONT'D)
          How long have you and Dewey been
          married?

                    GALE
          Almost ten years ago.

                    REBECCA
          Aw. So it was just like your
          characters in STAB 3. Wow.

                       GALE
          Yeah, wow.
                                                          34


                    REBECCA
          I didn't mean bad wow. It just
          always seemed like more of a movie
          romance than a real one because it
          was a movie and in real life you
          two would never be...
              (catches herself)
          Ooh, don't wanna dig that hole, so,
          how many kids do you have?

Gale stares at her, blankly.   As the hole gets deeper.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - WOODSBORO - DAY

Several MEDIA OUTLETS have planted themselves outside the
POLICE STATION. Olivia and Kirby watch the ruckus from the
water fountain. Charlie is there too.

                    OLIVIA
          I don't understand why the killer
          called Jill?

                    KIRBY
          She's been tapped. She's related
          to Sidney. It makes it personal.

                    CHARLIE
          It puts Jill up next on the victim
          chain. If the killer calls, you're
          dead, that's the rule.

                    KIRBY
          An overused, done to death rule.

                    CHARLIE
          You can blame techno J-horror.

                    OLIVIA
          What?

                    KIRBY
              (explains)
          THE RING, GRUDGE, ONE MISSED CALL.

Charlie and Kirby talk in a language that is foreign to
Olivia.

                    CHARLIE
          Someone's gotta bite it.  You
          can't kill Sidney. She's victim
          royalty, she can't die.
                                                          35


                    KIRBY
          Sure she can. Her character has
          been gone since STAB 3 anyway.

                       CHARLIE
          Too dicey.     Potential backlash.

                    KIRBY
          Laurie Strode bit it in HALLOWEEN
          8, Ripley died in ALIEN 4. There's
          precedence.

Olivia is completely confused by their conversation.

                    OLIVIA
          What are you guys talking about?

                    CHARLIE
              (duh)
          STAB. Someone's gonna make a
          sequel outta this. "STAB 8: RETURN
          TO WOODSBORO."

Charlie breaks out with the HALLOWEEN score while Kirby
mimics FRIDAY THE 13TH.

           CHARLIE                            KIRBY
Da-DA-da-DA-da-da...              Ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma...

                    OLIVIA
          This is real. This isn't a movie.

                    CHARLIE
          But it will be.

And that Charlie and Kirby are certain of.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

Deputy Hicks fills Dewey in on her findings.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          The cyber team is running a full
          surveillance on the cell phones.
          As soon as we get something--

                    DEWEY
          I want round the clock watch on
          Jill and Sidney. Use Hoss and
          Perkins.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          Any statement to the press?
                                                           36


                    DEWEY
          No comment.

Hicks nods.   Sees the strain on her boss' face.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          We'll get through this, Dewey.

She gives him a supportive smile. Just then, Gale plows into
his office. Hicks starts to object but Dewey allows it.

                       DEWEY
          It's okay.

Judy exits, trying to hide her disdain. Beat. As Dewey eyes
Gale. A long, strained look. This is hard on him.

                    GALE
          Do you have a suspect?

                    DEWEY
          We don't have enough as this point.

                    GALE
          Yea, but we've been down this road
          before. It's a certain type of
          killer that's attracted to Sidney
          Prescott. It shouldn't be too hard
          to find a horror movie freak with a
          motive and a cell phone.

Dewey stares at her in amazement.   She stares back.   What?

                    DEWEY
          You're excited about this.

                    GALE
          I'm trying to be proactive before
          someone else is killed.

                    DEWEY
          No, you're really excited about
          this.

                    GALE
          I had a cup of coffee.    What?

                    DEWEY
          This is an official murder
          investigation. You can't be a part
          of it.

                    GALE
          I'm not a reporter anymore.
                                                         37


                    DEWEY
          You're not a cop either, Gale.

Beat. This hits Gale hard. It's impact speaks to a much
bigger problem. Dewey's look is apologetic, but he's also
very busy.

                    DEWEY (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry, I've got work to do.

He exits, hurriedly.   Leaving Gale floored.

EXT. ROBERTS HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

A PATROL CAR is parked in front of the house.

INT. FOYER - ROBERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A large, old home. Not a lot of money. But comfortable.
Hoss is moving from room to room, checking it out. Perkins
can be seen going up the stairs.

Detective Hicks can be seen in the kitchen with Kate.
They're doing an official house, "Clear."

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - UPSTAIRS

Perkins checks out the guest room. He looks in the closet,
checks the windows. Secures them. The bedroom faces the
front of the house. His eyes scan the front yard and street.

INT. LIVING ROOM - ROBERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rebecca and Sidney are in the living room with their luggage.

                    REBECCA
          I had reservations at the
          Doubletree.

                    SIDNEY
          It'll be better here. All of us in
          numbers. We'll be safer.

Rebecca is resigned to make the most of it.

                    REBECCA
          As long as we're in Seattle by
          Tuesday. So what's the deal with
          your Aunt? Where's Jill's dad?

                    SIDNEY
          Aunt Kate is my mother's kid
          sister.

                                                            38

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          They're pretty much my only family
          now. And the father's not in the
          picture, so don't ask.

Rebecca nods.   Got it.   Just then, Jill enters.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          I can't get over how grown up you
          are. What's it been five years?

                    JILL
          It was the body morphing years.

                    SIDNEY
          It's good to see you.     Even
          though...

Jill nods. Gets the sentiment. She feels the same way.      A
KNOCK at the door. In seconds --

ALL THREE DEPUTIES SWARM TO THE FRONT DOOR.    Sidney and Jill
do a double-take. Impressive.

INT. FOYER - ROBERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Hicks opens the door to reveal Dewey -- eyeing his wrist
watch.

                    DEWEY
          I'm impressed.

Hicks smiles. Charmed by his boyish test.     He enters.   Looks
to Jill and Sidney.

                    DEWEY (CONT'D)
          I found a girl loitering outside.

                    KIRBY
          Step aside, Sheriff.

Kirby appears with take-out food.

                       KIRBY (CONT'D)
          Fried fat.     Who's with me?

She enters.   Jill's happy to see her.

INT. KITCHEN - ROBERTS HOME - NIGHT

Kate and Jill are preparing take-out while Rebecca pours
wine, all chatty.
                                                           39


                    KATE
          I was gonna cook.    I do know how.
          Thank you, hon.

Kate takes a glass of wine.    Drinks.

                    REBECCA
          This smells yummie.

                    KIRBY
          Oh good, you eat real food, I was
          worried.

Jill looks to the family room where Dewey and Sidney are
sitting on the couch.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE

Sidney and Dewey sit on the couch and catch up.

                    SIDNEY
          It's a 30 city tour. Barnes &
          Nobles, Seattle is next up. It's
          not easy to generate interest in
          inspirational self-help.

                    DEWEY
          You have the STAB audience.

                    REBECCA
          That audience doesn't read books.
          Shocker.

Rebecca interrupts with wine. Dewey sets his glass down on
the coffee table. He's "on duty". Rebecca returns to the
kitchen.

                    SIDNEY
          How have you been?

                    DEWEY
          You're very calm for what's going
          on around you.

                    SIDNEY
          I can't control what other people
          do. Now, how are you? How's Gale?

Sidney is positive and friendly.   Dewey finds it disarming.

                    DEWEY
          I'm good and Gale is... well, it's
          been a little rocky lately.
                                                             40


                       SIDNEY
             I'm sorry to hear that.

                       DEWEY
             She's not working and I don't think
             she knows who she is if she's not
             working.

                       SIDNEY
             Why isn't she?

                       DEWEY
             She was tabloid   TV. The internet
             killed a lot of   that. She hosted
             that True Crime   cable show for a
             while but... it   was canceled.

                       SIDNEY
             Isn't she writing another book?

He shrugs.    Sidney gets it.    Feels for her friend.

                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Gale's smart, she'll figure it out.

Dewey nods.    Hopeful.   He stares at Sid.    Impressed.

                       DEWEY
             You sure did. You really got it
             together.

She leans in -- whispers.

                       SIDNEY
             I'm scared shitless.   Ssh.

                        DEWEY
             That makes more sense.
                 (then)
             It's really nice to see you, Sid.

Sid smiles.    She's happy to see him too.

EXT. ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

A light breeze. Leaves blow across the lawn.       Hoss can be
seen sitting in a car, parked in front.

Dewey exits the house and moves down the walk to his JEEP.
He waves at Deputy Hoss.

                       DEWEY
             Eyes up, Hoss.
                                                            41


Hoss waves back.

INT. BATHROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sidney is brushing her teeth.   She spits, rinses, exits.

INT. HALLWAY - UPSTAIRS LANDING - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sidney moves down the hallway -- at the end is a door,
slightly ajar. Sid peaks in to reveal.

Rebecca is sleeping with her ear buds in -- her iPod laying
across her chest. Sid quietly closes the door, turns and
RUNS SMACK into DEPUTY HICKS. Sid JUMPS.

                     DEPUTY HICKS
           Sorry about that. I was just
           making my rounds.

                     SIDNEY
           No, it's okay.

                     DEPUTY HICKS
           Dewey left. He's on cell if you
           need him. I've got Perkins in the
           back and Hoss in front. Just
           shout.

                     SIDNEY
           Thanks.

Sid starts to her room when--

                     DEPUTY HICKS
           You don't remember me, do ya? We
           went to high school together. Judy
           Hicks. We had the same home room.

Sidney studies her a moment, tries to recall.

                     DEPUTY HICKS (CONT'D)
           And Drama Club, too. We were in
           Peter Pan together. I played a
           lost boy... you were Tiger Lily.

Sidney smiles politely. She still doesn't remember.   Deputy
Hicks tries to hide her disappointment.

                     DEPUTY HICKS (CONT'D)
           It's okay. You had a lot of stuff
           going on back then. And, well, I
           guess I wasn't very memorable.

Awkward.   Then...
                                                                42


                    SIDNEY
          It's nice to see you again, Judy.

Sid disappears down the hall. Hicks stares after her.
Bummed. And just a little irked too.

INT. JILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE TV SCREEN -- where two appropriate D-LIST STARS
have sex. The phone RINGS. Bad acting ensues.

                    JILL
          I don't wanna watch this.       It's in
          poor taste.

                    KIRBY
          Were you BFF's with Jenny or
          Marnie? I don't think so.

                    JILL
          That's not the point.

                    KIRBY
          It's cathartic, we're de-
          sensitizing our grief.

ON TV -- THE D-LIST ACTRESS SCREAMS as she's STABBED.

A KNOCK at the door.    Both GIRLS jump.    Kirby hits PAUSE.

                       JILL
          Come in.

The door opens -- it's Sidney.

                    SIDNEY
          You guys doing okay in here?

Sidney looks to the TV.       Sees the STAB movie on PAUSE.

                    KIRBY
          We were just... when in Rome.

                    SIDNEY
          Is this the one where Amy Poehler
          is the killer?

                    KIRBY
          Well, it's Heidi Klum first, then
          after the plastic surgery goes
          wrong, it's Amy Poehler. She kills
          all the skinny girls from the CW.
                                                           43


                      SIDNEY
          Right.    Well, good-night.

Sid's cool about.   She exits, closes the door.

                    JILL
              (idiot)
          "When in Rome?"

                    KIRBY
          I'm star-struck. DATELINE did a
          whole hour on her once. I watched
          it five times. She's the shit.

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sidney enters the guest bedroom. She goes to her open suit
case and finds lotion. She hops up on the bed and gets
comfortable.

INT. JILL'S BEDROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Kirby's CELL PHONE RINGS.   She looks at the CALLER ID:
OLIVIA.

                    KIRBY
              (answers)
          Yes, Olivia?

SCENE INTERCUTS:

EXT. DRIVEWAY - OLIVIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Olivia's car pulls up in her driveway across the street.

                    OLIVIA
              (into her cell)
          Is that your car? Are you at
          Jill's?

Kirby jumps up, looks out the window. Sees Olivia getting
out of her car across the street. They wave. Olivia moves
up the walk to her house. It's dark inside.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Great. My mom's not home yet.
          Let me speak to Jill.

Kirby hands Jill the phone.

                    KIRBY
          She wants to speak to you.

Jill takes the phone.
                                                               44


                       JILL
          What's up?

                    OLIVIA
          How are you? Did I miss anything?

                     JILL
          Nope.   I'm okay.

                    OLIVIA
          I'll be over in a few. I saw
          Trevor at practice tonight.

                    JILL
          What was he doing there?

Olivia enters her house.      CLICKS on a light.    Locks the door.

                    OLIVIA
          Picking up his equipment. He's
          done. They kicked him off the
          team.

                       JILL
          I know.

                    OLIVIA
          Did he tell you about A&M?      He lost
          the scholarship too.

Jill pauses.   She didn't know that.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          The guy's ruined. All for smoking
          a joint in the Locker Room.

                    JILL
          It was the Girl's Locker Room.

                    OLIVIA
          I know, I know...

Just then, Jill's CELL PHONE RINGS. Kirby eyes it on the
night stand. READS the CALLER ID: CHARLIE.

                    KIRBY
          It's Charlie.
              (answers it)
          What do you want?

                    MAN'S VOICE
              (from phone)
          Hello, Jill?
                                                            45


It's not Charlie -- it's the voice of Ghost Face.

                       KIRBY
             Nope, it's Kirby. Why are you
             doing this, Charlie?

                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'm not Charlie.

                       KIRBY
             What are you doing with Charlie's
             phone. Huh? Mr. Ghost Face?
                 (to Jill)
             It's Charlie being an asshole.

Jill waves it away.    She can't deal with him now.   She goes
back to Olivia.

                       JILL
             Do you think he fooled around with
             Jessica?

                       OLIVIA
             Shotgun make-out, yes.    Full on
             blow job, doubt it.

Jill nods.    She completely agrees.

                       MAN'S VOICE
                 (to Kirby)
             I want to talk to Jill.

                       KIRBY
                 (to Man)
             She doesn't want to talk to you.

IN OLIVIA'S BEDROOM - She's changing into sweats.

                       OLIVIA
             Then again, Jessica's a little
             hoochie le-whore.

                       KIRBY
             C'mon, Ghost Face, talk to me.
             Aren't you supposed to ask me a
             question. Go ahead, horror quiz
             me, Cuz', you know Charlie -- you
             can't stump me.

                       MAN'S VOICE
             How's the movie?

                       KIRBY
             What movie?
                                                   46


Kirby stops.   Goes silent.

                     MAN'S VOICE
           STAB PART 6?

                     KIRBY
           How do you know we're watching
           that?

                     MAN'S VOICE
           Because I'm standing in the closet.

Kirby spins around to Jill's closed closet door.

                      KIRBY
           Stop.   You are not.

Jill sees Kirby staring at her closet door.

                     JILL
               (to Kirby)
           What's going on?

                     KIRBY
               (to Jill)
           Charlie's being a dick.

                     MAN'S VOICE
           THIS IS NOT FUCKING CHARLIE!

                     KIRBY
           Then who the fuck are you?

                     MAN'S VOICE
           Open the closet door.

                     KIRBY
           You do know there's cops all over
           this house.

                     MAN'S VOICE
           I think I'd have just enough time
           to slice someone open.

Beat.   Kirby grows cautious.     Chilled.

                     JILL
               (to Kirby)
           Are you still talking to Charlie?

                     OLIVIA
               (on cell to Jill)
           What's going on over there?
                                                            47


                    JILL
              (to Olivia)
          Kirby is being weird.

Kirby stares at the closet.     She's hesitating.

                    KIRBY
              (to man)
          There's no way you're in there.

Kirby reaches for the door knob.    Her hand shakes some.

                    JILL
              (to Kirby)
          What are you doing?

Suddenly, she RIPS THE CLOSET DOOR OPEN.    It's empty.   Relief
floods Kirby's face.

                    KIRBY
              (to man)
          Liar. I'm over this.

                    MAN'S VOICE
          I never said I was in your closet.

SMASH CUT TO OLIVIA'S BEDROOM

Olivia is still on the phone with Jill when...

A GHOST FACED FIGURE EXPLODES FROM HER CLOSET.

Surprised and stunned -- she barely has time to react when
the GHOST FACE is upon her.

BACK IN JILL'S BEDROOM

Both Jill and Kirby HEAR OLIVIA SCREAM.

                       JILL
          Olivia?     Olivia?

                    KIRBY
          What's happening?

They turn to each other.    Olivia can be heard SCREAMING from
both of their phones.

IN OLIVIA'S BEDROOM

A LARGE BUTCHER KNIFE STRIKES. It tears into Olivia's arm,
slicing her flesh. She SCREAMS and TUMBLES backwards. The
cell phone hits the floor.
                                                                48


ON JILL AND KIRBY -- Confused. Crazed. They race to the
window and look across the street. They can make out a
struggle, a Ghost Face... but then the light goes out.

             JILL                                KIRBY
Olivia... what's happening?         Olivia?   Nooo... Olivia?

IN SIDNEY'S BEDROOM

Sidney HEARS SCREAMING.     She bolts from her bed.

ON OLIVIA

As she tries in vain to flee. But the Ghost Face cuts her
off, SMASHING into her. She goes CRASHING to the floor. She
crawls to her knees and tries again.

The GHOST FACE is upon her again. KNIFE RAISED.       Olivia
CRIES OUT -- one last blood curdling SCREAM.

                        OLIVIA
            Nooooo!!!

CLICK.   Both lines go dead.     A moment of frozen horror.

Both girls are SCREAMING IN TERROR when Sidney comes racing
into the room.   They point to the window.

Sidney goes to the window.

                      JILL
            The house -- Olivia!

SIDNEY'S POV - The house is now dark.     Suddenly, a FLASHING
LIGHT takes her eye.

IT COMES FROM OLIVIA'S UPSTAIRS BEDROOM.

CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE -- OVERCOME WITH HORROR

As she stares into Olivia's bedroom window to see a GHOST
FACED FIGURE holding Olivia by the neck. She's still alive --
terrified, hurt, whimpering -- but alive.

                        SIDNEY
            Nooooo...

Sidney watches as the GHOST FACE picks up the LARGE KNIFE.
Then, turns to the window and stares back at Sidney --
taunting her.

Sidney SCREAMS. Beats the window. God... No... She jumps
into action. She bolts from the bedroom. Running, racing,
nearly falling down the stairs...
                                                            49


                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          Get the police...

She SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER. But she wastes no time stopping.
She RIPS OPEN THE FRONT DOOR and...

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Sid bolts out of the house, running across the street,
SCREAMING HER LUNGS OUT.

                    SIDNEY
          He's killing her!    Where are you?

She sees the DEPUTY'S PATROL CAR. Goes to it. But no sign
of Deputy Hicks or anyone. She BEATS on the hood.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          Where are you, people? Goddammit!

Jill and Kirby come racing out of the house after Sidney.
She SCREAMS at them.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          Call the police. Now.

She runs, bare foot, across the street. Kirby goes racing
back inside the house while Jill debates.

EXT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sid races up the drive, to the front door. IT'S LOCKED. She
goes to the window next to it. She picks up a POTTED PLANT
and throws it through.

GLASS SHATTERS.    Sidney climbs in after it.

INT. OLIVIA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sidney can't be stopped. She races through the living room.
Her feet bloody from broken glass. She climbs the stairs...

UPSTAIRS LANDING

It's dark. Sidney sees a light through a door.   She bursts
through it to find...

OLIVIA'S BODY on the bed -- propped up against the headboard.
Her stomach ripped open. Her insides exposed. BLOOD
EVERYWHERE.

She's too late. The sight overwhelms Sid. She erupts into
tears. Her knees fail her. She clutches the door to keep
from falling. Then, a PHONE RINGS.
                                                            50


Sid turns to find a CELL PHONE sitting on the dresser -- as
if waiting for her. She picks it up, brings it to her ear.
A long silence. And then...

                    MAN'S VOICE
              (from phone)
          Welcome home, Sidney.

                      SIDNEY
          Nooooo...

                    MAN'S VOICE
          I've missed you.

Sidney is defiant.    She SCREAMS in anger.

                    SIDNEY
          What do you want?

                    MAN'S VOICE
          It's time for another movie.    I've
          been waiting.

                      SIDNEY
          Fuck you.

                    MAN'S VOICE
          Only one more, Sid. It'll be your
          last one. I promise. STAB. The
          Death of Sidney Prescott. Based on
          a true story. It'll be the best
          one yet.

CLICK. The PHONE goes DEAD.     A NOISE BEHIND HER.   Sid spins
around to see...

Jill racing up the stairs.

                    SIDNEY
          Don't come up here.

But Jill doesn't stop. She gets to the top of the staircase.
Sid goes to her -- to block her from seeing Olivia's body.

                    JILL
          No, please... Is she?

                    SIDNEY
          I'm sorry...

Just as Sidney goes to Jill--

GHOST FACE LUNGES FROM THE HALL CLOSET -- KNIFE RAISED.
                                                         51


He BARRELS into Sidney -- but she's fast -- she spins around
and KNOCKS him against the wall. As Jill races to help, the
GHOST FACE turns on her -- KNIFE RAISED.

Sidney LUNGES at him. The KNIFE STRIKES JILL IN THE ARM --
slices open her shirt -- as Sidney and the GHOST FACE go
TUMBLING down the stairs.

Together -- intertwined. They hit the base of the stairs.
Hard. The GHOST FACE instantly rises. But, Sid is
disoriented. She tries to crawl away but GHOST FACE pulls
her back when...

Sidney KICKS the GHOST FACE off of her -- she scrambles to
her feet, racing to the door, coming face to face with.

DEPUTY HOSS AND DEPUTY PERKINS -- their guns drawn on her.

She turns around to discover -- GHOST FACE has disappeared.
Deputy Hoss takes off in pursuit while Deputy Perkins goes to
Sidney. He tries to help her -- but she pushes him away.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          Where were you?

Sidney is upset and angry. She sees Jill coming down the
stairs, clutching a bleeding arm. Sid races to her. Sidney
turns to Deputy Perkins.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          Help me with her.

Perkins springs into action, aiding Jill.

EXT. OLIVIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Crime scene chaos. SQUAD CARS, AMBULANCE, CORONER'S VAN,
POLICE OFFICERS, DETECTIVES, NEWS VANS, REPORTERS, NEIGHBORS,
OFFICERS, DETECTIVES...

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

An AMBULANCE SPEEDS away, revealing Dewey. He eyes Hicks
with Perkins and Hoss -- marches over. They instantly start
defending themselves.

                    DEPUTY PERKINS
          I saw someone in the Ghost costume.
          He went in the alley.

                    DEPUTY HOSS
          I saw him too, Sheriff.
                                                         52


                      DEPUTY HICKS
            And they radioed and I circled
            around to cut him off.

                      DEWEY
            While the killer circled back to
            the girl's house.

                      DEPUTY PERKINS
            He got us with the other house,
            Sheriff.

The Deputies know they screwed up. Big time. Just then, the
CORONER and his TEAM carry Olivia's body out of the house.
The sight weighs heavily on Dewey.

EXT. HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A small town hospital. The MEDIA has descended upon the main
steps. CAMERAS and REPORTERS everywhere.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

A flurry of activity. Whirls around Sidney and Jill.
NURSES, MEDICS, DOCTORS...

They're being treated side by side. Jill sits reclined in a
bed, as DOCTOR ORTH, 38, handsome and confident, bandages her
wound. She WINCES. Kate is there -- quietly panicked.

                      JILL
            You didn't hear us screaming?

                      KATE
            Two glasses of wine and an Ambien.
            I didn't hear anything.

Just then, Kirby comes racing in.

                      KIRBY
            They told me it was a surface
            wound. Surface wounds are okay.

They hug.

                       JILL
            Ow.   Surface wounds hurt.

                      KIRBY
                (to a nurse)
            Oxycotin stat.
                                                              53


Dr. Orth goes to Sidney, one bed over. An INTERN removes
small bits of glass from her feet. Dr. Orth inspects it.
With his right hand, he checks an abrasion on her foot.

                    DR. ORTH
          It's not bad, believe or not.
          How's the head?

                    SIDNEY
          Massive hangover.

The doctor holds her stare too long.    Sidney senses it.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          Did we go to school together?

                    DR. ORTH
          You went to school with my younger
          brother, Steve. You may not
          remember, but he was...

                    SIDNEY
          Steven Orth. Yes, of course, I do.
          And he had a brother, Danny, who
          was in med school.

He's taken aback.   Surprised, she remembers.

                    DR. ORTH
          Most people forget about Steve.
          The guy tied to the chair in the
          back yard, killed off in the
          opening scene. Generic victim #1.
          Not even part of the story.

The doctor clearly has some residual feelings.     Over his
shoulder, Gale approaches. Excitedly.

                    GALE
          Dewey called me.    I came.   Whatever
          I can do.

                    SIDNEY
          You can help me find Rebecca.
              (to nurse)
          Have you seen my assistant?

Sidney hops off the bed, WINCING as her feet hit the floor.
She slips into her shoes, not stopping. She's leaving and
very determined about it.

                    GALE
          Dewey said you talked to the
          killer? What did he say?
                                                            54


                    SIDNEY
          He told me to leave town as quickly
          as possible.

                       GALE
          He did?

                    SIDNEY
          He said the next STAB movie was
          about the death of Sidney Prescott.
          I interpret that as: Get the hell
          out of town now.

Sidney sees a weary Rebecca entering.   She's shell-shocked.

                    REBECCA
          Good. You're okay. Cuz' there's
          tons of press requests...

                    SIDNEY
          We're leaving tonight. We'll drive
          to Oakland and fly standby.
          Where's the rental?

                    REBECCA
          In the lot. There's a lot of press
          out there. Let me pull the car up.
          I'll text you.

Rebecca takes off -- grateful to be leaving.    Gale watches as
Sidney collects her things.

                    GALE
          Leaving may not be the best thing
          to do, Sidney.

Sidney looks at her.    Jill and Kirby take notice.   As does
Dr. Orth.

                    SIDNEY
          You're kidding me, right? I came
          back here and people are dead.

                    GALE
          How were you supposed to know some
          psycho was planning a sequel?

                    SIDNEY
          You'd like that wouldn't you, Gale?

                       GALE
          Excuse me?
                                                             55


                     JILL (O.S.)
           Are you leaving, Sidney?

Sidney turns to see Jill.   Sid goes to her full of
compassion.

                     SIDNEY
           Someone is out there killing people
           because I'm here. I have to go
           before someone else gets hurt.

Beat.   Sadly, this makes sense to Jill.   To all of them.

EXT. HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING

The PRESS is having a field day with the news of another
murder. Amongst the CROWD is Trevor. Watching.

                     REPORTER #1
           Another young girl is dead tonight
           and Woodsboro is once again the
           setting for a real life horror
           movie...

Rebecca emerges from the hospital. She hides behind TWO
SECURITY GUARDS trying to figure out the best way to maneuver
the crowd when Dewey comes barreling through.

The REPORTERS swarm him as he makes his way to the doors.
Rebecca uses this as her opportunity to flee. She darts
through the crowd. Unnoticed.

"Sheriff." "A statement." "Anything." The Sheriff reaches
the top of the stairs and turns to the CAMERAS as microphones
are shoved in his face.

                     DEWEY
           I can assure you that we are doing
           everything we can to apprehend
           those responsible.

                     REPORTER
           So you think there's more than one
           killer?

                     DEWEY
           We can't rule it out yet.

Reporters continue to grill him.
                                                              56


EXT. PARKING LOT - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

A dimly lit lot. Rows and rows of parked cars. Rebecca
appears moving through them. She looks around, unable to
remember where the rental is parked.

She presses keys. BEEP. The RENTAL CAR'S LIGHTS FLASH two
rows over. She starts for it when her CELL PHONE RINGS. She
digs into her bag. Pulls it out with her ear piece.

It's marked BLOCKED CALLED.      She answers, inserting her
bluetooth ear piece.

                    REBECCA
              (into cell)
          This is Rebecca.

                    MAN'S VOICE
              (but not so obvious)
          Sidney Prescott please?

                    REBECCA
          This is her assistant, Rebecca
          Walters. Can I take a message?

                    MAN'S VOICE
          Yes, please?

Rebecca starts to dig in her bag for a pen and paper.

                    REBECCA
          Okay, sure, um...
              (thinks better of it)
          Actually, this is a really bad
          time. May I call you back?

Rebecca crosses to the car. She regrets picking up the
phone. So not the time for this shit.

                    MAN'S VOICE
          It's really important.      It will
          just take a second.

                    REBECCA
          What is it?

                    MAN'S VOICE
          Please tell Sidney that it's very
          important that she doesn't -- are
          you writing this down?

                       REBECCA
          Yes, I am.
                                                              57


Rebecca's not writing shit.   She's lying.

                    MAN'S VOICE
          Are you sure? It sounds like
          you're walking.

                    REBECCA
          I'm writing. Who is this?

Rebecca arrives at the rental car.    BEEPS the door.   Opens it
and slides in.

INSIDE THE CAR

                    MAN'S VOICE
          Please let Sidney know it's
          imperative that she not leave town
          and to illustrate this I'm going to
          kill her assistant.

                    REBECCA
          Excuse me...?

CLICK. The phone goes dead. It takes a second for this to
register. Horror fills Rebecca's face.

She LOCKS the car doors, STARTS the ENGINE. Looks to the
left and right then spins around and peers into the back
seat. It's empty. She turns back when--

A HAND BURSTS THROUGH THE DRIVER'S WINDOW GRABBING HER
THROAT.

Rebecca's SCREAM is cut short.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - HOSPITAL

Sidney is still with Gale and Jill.   Aunt Kate and Kirby are
there too. Then--

Sid's CELL PHONE RINGS.   The CALLER ID says Rebecca.   She
picks it up.

                     SIDNEY
          Bec?   Are you out front?

                    MAN'S VOICE
          Yes, Sidney, you'll find Rebecca
          right out front.

Sidney face falls. Noooooo.    She takes off running.   Gale
and the others follow.
                                                          58


EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Dewey continues to answer reporter's questions at the
hospital's entrance.

                    DEWEY
          The police department is working
          around the clock to make sure no
          one else is hurt.

Behind the CROWD OF REPORTERS, Rebecca's rental car can be
seen drifting down the road. Coasting. Building speed on
the road's incline. Growing closer and closer -- headed
directly for the CROWD.

Finally, people start to notice. "Watch out." The car is
headed right for the hospital's entrance. Dewey sees it.

                    DEWEY (CONT'D)
          Guys, watch it, move aside.

Instant commotion. As the car parts the CROWD.   Sidney and
the others emerge from the hospital as--

The car CRASHES into a MEDIA VAN. Through the busted side
window -- Rebecca's lifeless body can be seen behind the
wheel. Her throat slashed.

Horrific SCREAMS from all around.   As the CAMERAS film every
second of it.

INT. WAITING ROOM - HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER

A waiting room has been taken over by the police. Jill sits
on a couch -- Kirby is curled up asleep, next to her. Aunt
Kate is there too.

                    KATE
          How's your arm?

                       JILL
          It's okay.     Sore.

Gale passes with coffee. She takes a seat next to Sidney.
Offers her a coffee. Sid takes it.

                    GALE
          Rebecca's family has been notified.

A long beat.

                    SIDNEY
          I never should have come back here.
                                                       59


                    GALE
          This isn't your fault, Sid. If
          anything it's mine. I wrote the
          book, I sold the movie rights. I
          started this.

Sidney looks at her.

                     SIDNEY
          You're right. It is your fault.
          But I knew better.
              (then)
          Now, I can't leave. We have to
          keep her safe.

Sidney is referring to Jill.

                       GALE
          We will.

                    SIDNEY
          I don't care what happens to me.
          But no one else can get hurt.

Sidney is absolute and determined.   Gale nods.

INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Dewey is with Deputy Hicks.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          The Cyber team is working on
          triangulating the cell phones.   We
          should have something soon.

Gale marches up, determined.

                    GALE
          Anything at all?

                    DEWEY
          We're on it, Gale.

                    GALE
          Don't do that. Don't cut me out of
          this. I'm a part of this.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          It's not protocol, Gale, for the
          Sheriff's wife to be involved--

Gale spins around -- ready to rip Hicks' throat out.
                                                            60


                     GALE
           And who is talking to Deputy Judy?
           Not me.

Dewey jumps in between them.     Ushers Gale off to the side.

                     DEWEY
           Okay, you can help.    Just be nice.

Gale looks at Dewey, very seriously.    Very troubled.

                     GALE
           We have to stop this, Dewey, before
           anyone else dies.

He nods.   In total agreement.

EXT. LANDSCAPRE - MORNING

The sun rises over the majestic rolling hills of a beautiful
Northern California landscape. Quiet. Tranquil.

INT. JILL'S BEDROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - MORNING

The sun shines through the window. Illuminating Jill in bed.
Her eyes flutter open. She awakens. YAWNS.

She gets up and peers out the window. Sees HOSS and PERKINS
below -- standing guard. Alert and ready.

A GROUP OF REPORTERS camp out too.     Then, across the street--

OLIVIA'S HOUSE

Covered in police tape. Now, a crime scene. A quiet moment.
As Jill truly awakens to the nightmare she's living.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Sidney is drinking coffee, while talking on her cell.

                     SIDNEY
               (into cell)
           I'm staying. I'd prefer if
           everything could be channeled
           through your office. Thank you,
           Henry, I appreciate that. I'll let
           you know more as I know it. Bye.

Sid hangs up as Jill enters the kitchen. Sid goes straight
for her and hugs her. It's comforting to Jill.

                     SIDNEY (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry about Olivia.
                                                       61


Jill tears up.

                     SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          You know when people say, "I know
          how you feel," but you know they're
          just saying that and have no
          friggin' clue how you feel?
              (then)
          I know how you feel.

Sidney's look says it all. She does know. Jill appreciates
it, finding comfort in Sidney's quiet strength.

                    JILL
          Where's mom?

                    SIDNEY
          She stopped by work for a bit.

                    JILL
          I saw all the reporters outside.

                    SIDNEY
          That's why we're inside.

Sid hands Jill a cup of coffee.

                    JILL
          How do you deal with it? With
          everything that's happened to you?
          You've seen so much...

                    SIDNEY
          Death?
              (a moment)
          It sucks. I hate my life. I
          didn't ask for it. But running
          from it gets me nowhere. I've
          learned to embrace it.

                    JILL
          How did you do that?

Sidney shrugs.

                    SIDNEY
          I wrote a book about grief and
          guilt and hope.

                    JILL
          And it helped?
                                                           62


                    SIDNEY
          It helped... pay the bills. The
          thing that helped most, which I
          worded differently in the book, is
          I finally said, "Fuck it." This is
          it. Your life. You can boo-hoo or
          get on with it. I've earned the
          right to say, "Fuck it." So I did.

Sid is very frank.   Jill appreciates it.   She likes this side
of Sidney.

                    JILL
          I didn't know you had edge.

                    SIDNEY
              (poised)
          I'm so polite, aren't I? Things
          are never what they seem, Jill.
          That I can assure you.

                    JILL
          I don't think I'd like the
          attention. People staring at me.

                    SIDNEY
          People stare at me?

As if she didn't know.   Sidney smiles.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          I won't lie. I'd love to
          disappear. Be somebody else.
          Start from scratch. No scars.     But
          that's not reality.

Jill smiles.   In adoration.   She looks up to Sidney.

EXT. WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

The SHERIFF'S JEEP and TWO PATROL CARS are parked in front.
Dewey and Gale are there with Deputy Hicks and SEVERAL OTHER
DEPUTIES.

A brainy technician, TONY, 30, holds open a laptop.

                    TONY
          I triangulated the cell phones.
          The one used to call Jenny Randall,
          Jenny Randall's cell that was used
          to call Jill Roberts and now
          Charlie Walker's cell.

Tony points to the laptop.
                                                            63


ON LAPTOP SCREEN -- A digital map of Woodsboro. Several
CLICKS and it ZOOMS to the school. THREE BEEPS.

                       TONY (CONT'D)
             See the signal strength? Those
             phones are here. On this campus.

                       DEWEY
             What's the accuracy?

                       TONY
             The Lab's GPS can get within 300
             feet.

Gale takes the lead.

                       GALE
             Great, you guys find the phones.
             Dewey and I will begin questioning
             suspects.

They all stare at Gale.        Especially Dewey.

                       DEWEY
                 (annoyed)
             What are you doing? Do you see
             this? It's a badge. My badge.
             Where's yours? Oh, right, you
             don't have one.

                       GALE
             You said I could come.

                       DEWEY
             I said you could observe.

                        GALE
             Consult.

                        DEWEY
             Quietly.

Hicks and the others watch their marital bliss in action.
Dewey takes charge.

                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Now, you guys find the phones and
             we'll begin questioning suspects.

Gale nods.    She couldn't have said it better herself.
                                                              64


INT. HALLWAY - WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

A busy corridor. STUDENTS come and go, eyeing the DEPUTIES
as they move amongst them. Mr. Baker is seen, watching too.

AT THE END OF THE HALL

Robbie has his FLIP CAMERA out, filming.      While Charlie
stands next to him.

                    CHARLIE
          Somebody is looking for a killer.

                       ROBBIE
          Incoming.

Robbie refers to Dewey and Gale approaching.

                    DEWEY
          Charlie Walker?

Charlie raises his hand.

INT. AUDIO VISUAL LAB - WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Gale looks around the room. Sees all the video equipment and
computers and film-making paraphernalia. And the posters on
the wall. Lots of horror movie posters.

                    GALE
          What is this place?

                    CHARLIE
          Audio visual lab. We're one rung
          below the Glee club.

                     ROBBIE
          We're awaiting our own TV show.       We
          have hope.

                    CHARLIE
          First, let me just say, it is a
          supreme honor to be a suspect. May
          we film the interrogation?

Robbie films with his FLIP. Deputy Hicks casually takes it
from him. Dewey and Gale eye Charlie.

             GALE                                DEWEY
Where's your cell phone,             Where's your cell phone, son?
Charlie?

Dewey looks to Gale.    "Shut up".
                                                    65


       CHARLIE (CONT'D)                    ROBBIE
I lost it.                     It was stolen.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I don't know what happened to   it.
          Your Deputy asked already. I    can't
          find it. Not since lunch
          yesterday. I sat it down for    two
          seconds to grab a burrito and   a
          Rockstar -- gone.

                    ROBBIE
          He'll submit to a polygraph.

                    DEWEY
          Where were you last night?

                    CHARLIE
          I know someone used it in Olivia's
          murder. But it wasn't me. I
          stayed in. Watched WICKER MAN.
          The original. Ask my mom. Look,
          I'm a horror junkie, to state the
          obvious, but I like my violence in
          movies, not in reality.

                    DEWEY
          Maybe, you can't tell the
          difference between the two.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm not Billy Loomis, Sheriff. If
          anything, I'm Randy, the film geek.
          I just got accepted to Tisch.

                    ROBBIE
          He drops that, "Tisch", like it's
          gonna get him laid.

                    DEWEY
          That makes you a prime suspect in
          my book.

                    GALE
          He's right, he's too obvious.

                    CHARLIE
          Thank you. Besides, I don't do
          teen slasher. I'm more cult,
          Argento, early Lynch, my tastes are
          subversive.
                                                           66


                    ROBBIE
          Very subversive. Henry Knowles is
          irrelevant.

                    CHARLIE
          I'd never partake in some lame
          sequelitis retread.

                    GALE
          Is that what you think is going on?

Both boys nod.   These guys are "Who's on first" with their
timing.

                    CHARLIE
          Oh yeah, someone's trying to bring
          the STAB franchise back with a
          reboot.

                    ROBBIE
          Re-imagining.

                    CHARLIE
          And it sucks. It doesn't need to
          be brought back. This genre trend
          of shit remakes needs to stop. Rob
          Zombie.

                    ROBBIE
          Michael Bay.

                    CHARLIE
          Because for every DARK KNIGHT
          there's 50 PROM NIGHTS.

Dewey looks to Gale.   She shakes her head.   These guys are
harmless.

Just then, a TAP on the door.   Dewey looks up to see Deputy
Hicks motioning to them.

EXT. PARKING LOT - WOODSBORO HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Deputy Hicks leads Dewey and Gale through the school's
parking lot.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          We got a hit.

Tony is there with a cell phone.
                                                               67


                    TONY
          Jenny Randall's cell and Charlie
          Walker's cell. I'm dialing them
          now.

A MUFFLED RINGTONE comes from the trunk of the car.

                    TONY (CONT'D)
          And now Charlie Walker's.

A few seconds and the 2001 THEME RINGTONE plays.

                    GALE
          Let's open it.

                    DEWEY
          Who's car is this?

                       MR. BAKER (O.S.)
          It's mine.     What's going on?

They turn to see school teacher, Mr. Baker, approach.

                    DEWEY
          We need you to open your trunk.

Mr. Baker pulls out his KEYS and BEEPS.     The trunk opens.

The very first thing everyone sees is the GHOST FACE staring
up. It's stained with blood. They all turn to Mr. Baker.
Hands on their holsters.

INT. JILL'S BEDROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - AFTERNOON

CLOSE ON THE TV -- THE LOCAL NEWS.    It's MUTED.

Jill is on the bed with her laptop talking to Kirby -- via
iChat. Kirby is at her house.

                    JILL
          I'm sick of this house. It's
          creepy being here after last night.

                    KIRBY
          Come over here. We'll be sad
          together. Bring your body guards.

                     JILL
          Maybe.   I dunno what to do.

                    KIRBY

                    KIRBY

INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - ROBERTS HOUSE

Jill moves to the top of the stairs.    She can partially see
Sidney -- she's on the phone.

                    SIDNEY
              (on phone)
          I'm postponing the tour
          indefinitely. I can't...

Jill returns to her bedroom.

INT. JILL'S BEDROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Jill enters, closes the door to reveal TREVOR.    Jill JUMPS.

                      JILL
          Trevor.    How did you get in here?

                    TREVOR
          The same way I always do. The
          patio stairs. I had to see you.
          I'm sorry about Olivia.

                    JILL
          You shouldn't be here.

He ignores this.    He goes to her, inspects her bandaged arm.

                    TREVOR
          Are you okay? I was worried. I
          know I screwed up but I care about
          you. I can't just turn that off.
          You were almost killed.

His sincerity is convincing.   Jill softens.    Beat.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Do they have any idea who did it?
                                                       69


                    JILL
          No. They think it's, ya know, like
          in the movies.

Jill can't help herself. She's glad he's there. Despite
their issues. He takes her in his arms. They hug for a long
moment. Finally...

                    JILL (CONT'D)
          This doesn't mean anything.    I
          don't forgive you.

But she continues to hold him.

                    TREVOR
          You shouldn't. I'm guilty.

Jill pulls away.   Looks at him.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
          I screwed up. I'm not going to
          lie. Not after what's happened to
          you. Jessica and I lit up and got
          stoned, we messed around and got
          caught. None of it matters now.

He's powerfully honest.   This hits Jill hard.

                    JILL
          You lost your scholarship.

                    TREVOR
          Guess I didn't want it. That's
          what my mom said. She said I
          sabotaged myself.

Just then, the DOOR OPENS.   It's Sidney.

                    SIDNEY
          Hey, are you hungry?     I'm sorry--

She's surprised to see Trevor in the room.

                    JILL
          It's okay, Sid. This is Trevor.
          He was just leaving.

Trevor looks to Jill. She's incredibly confused. Her face
says it's time for him to go. He gets up and starts out.

                    TREVOR
          Yeah, I was leaving.
                                                          70


At the doorway, he passes by Sidney -- extremely close.
Their eyes meet.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
          It's nice to meet you. You're
          smaller in person.

Trevor and Sidney's eyes meet. He smiles. It's just enough
to make Sid uncomfortable. She takes a step back, allows
Trevor room to pass. Then, covers to Jill.

Just then, NOISE from outside takes their attention. They
both go to look out the window. The REPORTERS are packing up
and taking off.

                    SIDNEY
          Something happened.

They turn to the TV -- Jill HITS the VOLUME.

          A suspect is now in custody.

Jill and Sidney share a look.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

Mr. Baker sits in the hot seat.   Dewey questions him.

                    MR. BAKER
          This is crazy. Somebody put those
          things in my car.

                    DEWEY
          And how did they do that, Mr.
          Baker?

                    MR. BAKER
          Twenty different ways to Sunday is
          how. C'mon, Sheriff--

BEHIND THE GLASS

Gale and Deputy Hicks watch.

                    GALE
          He didn't do it.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          How can you tell? The evidence is
          overwhelming.
                                                         71


                    GALE
          Because the evidence   is
          overwhelming. Would    you leave
          three cell phones, a   mask, and a
          bloody knife in your   trunk?

BACK IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM

Mr. Baker is beginning to get worried.

                    MR. BAKER
          Look, I'm being framed.   It's
          obvious.

                    DEWEY
          Who would want to frame you?

                    MR. BAKER
          I could make a list. I'm an
          asshole. Ask any of my students.

Dewey slides a pad and paper towards him.

                    DEWEY
          Why don't you make a list?

                    MR. BAKER
          I'm getting really nervous here.
          I think I should speak to a lawyer
          before this goes any further.

Mr. Baker sits back in his chair. He's done talking.   Dewey
looks to the mirror -- shakes his head.

BEHIND THE GLASS

Gale and Hicks continue.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          He lawyered up fast.

                    GALE
          He's innocent.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          Could I play devil's advocate for a
          moment. Maybe he never thought
          we'd look in the trunk. Maybe he
          didn't have time to dispose of the
          evidence. Maybe he's stupid.

Gale looks to her.
                                                           72


                    GALE
          What would you like us to do,
          Deputy Judy?

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          I think we should hold him.

                    GALE
          Sure, why not. And if no one else
          dies, then we'll know you were
          right. But until then, we have a
          killer to find.

Gale starts off as Hicks stops her, troubled by something.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          Um, Gale? Small thing.   It's
          Deputy Hicks. Or Judy.   But not
          Deputy Judy.

Gale resists the urge to rip her apart.    Instead, she smiles.

                    GALE
          Got it. Another small thing. It's
          okay to be in love with my husband
          but if you ever act on it -- I'll
          cut your balls off.

Gale exits.   Off Deputy Hicks--

EXT. KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A huge spatial home.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

A big family room/game room. A pool table and other games on
one side. A huge FLAT SCREEN home theatre set-up on the
other.

Robbie is shooting pool while Kirby is selecting MUSIC.

                    KIRBY
          We should have guessed Baker. He
          was too quiet. Repressed mommy
          issues.

                    ROBBIE
          It's this town. Woodsboro.      It
          breeds psychos. Why are we
          listening to this crap?
                                                           73


                    KIRBY
          Because tonight is about Olivia and
          I found her iPod in my car and this
          is her playlist. You're free to
          leave.

Kirby is adamant.

                    ROBBIE
          Great tunes, dude.      To Olivia.

                       KIRBY
          Thank you.

Kirby moves into the connecting kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - KIRBY'S HOUSE

A spacious kitchen. Built into the walls of the kitchen are
SEVERAL SECURITY CAMERAS.

Kirby eyes one. Sees Jill and the Deputies coming up the
walk. She races to the door.

INT. FOYER - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kirby opens the front door to greet Jill.

                    KIRBY
          You made it.

                    JILL
          They need to take a look around.

                       KIRBY
          Sure.     Come on in.

Hoss and Perkins enter after Jill.     They look around.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sid sits in an over-sized chair watching TV. She channel
surfs. It's wall to wall coverage of the murders. A NEWS
ANCHOR talks to a REPORTER in the field.

                    NEWS ANCHOR
              (from TV)
          Was an arrest made? Or is Stuart
          Baker only a person of interest?

                    FIELD REPORTER
          It's unclear. However, sources say
          the evidence is substantial.
                                                             74


Sid SWITCHES channels. More coverage. Images of the
victims. Of herself. Past victims. (Randy, Tatum) Past
killers. (Billy Loomis, Micky) The current victims. Gale's
book. Of Gale reporting. Past and present merge together
with every flip of the remote.

Sidney switches it over to a GOSSIP SHOW on the E CHANNEL.

                    GOSSIP HOST
          "Spatial Films announced today the
          next sequel in the STAB franchise
          has been fast tracked. No doubt
          due to the four murders that..."

Sid gives up.   She turns the TV OFF when she hears...

TAT-TAT-TAT.    A NOISE.   She freezes.   Looks to patio doors.

Sidney rises and goes to the TWO LARGE GLASS doors that lead
to the deck and back yard.

It's dark. She FLIPS the back porch light.      JUMPS.   Startled
by her own reflection. Jesus...

She instantly sees the source of the NOISE. A WIND CHIME has
tangled itself around the post of the back porch. The night
breeze causes it to TAT-TAT against the post.

She OPENS the door and steps out onto the...

EXT. BACK DECK - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sid quickly tries to untangle the chime. She's very
vulnerable standing out there alone. The yard is pitch black
around her.

She pulls on the chime and ends up bringing it down on top of
her. Shit. She then attempts to hang it back up but it's
too much trouble. Fuck it. She tosses it to the side of the
porch.

She steps back inside.     Locks the door.   TURNS the outside
light out.

INT. KITCHEN - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sid enters the kitchen and goes to the fridge.     Opens it and
grabs a water when...

TAT-TAT-TAT.    Sid spins around to the family room.
                                                            75


INT. FAMILY ROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sidney approaches the back glass doors again.   Pitch black.
She CLICKS on the porch light to reveal--

The WIND CHIME is now back hanging from the porch post.
Right where it was. TAT-TAT. But how? Who put it back?
Sid's face goes pale when--

KATE'S HEAD POPS UP FROM BELOW THE WINDOW.   SID SCREAMS.

Kate was bent over looking under a potted plant.

                    KATE
          I can't find the key.

Sid recovers.   Opens the door.

                       SIDNEY
          It's okay.

                    KATE
          Where is everybody?

Kate goes inside.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          The wind chime fell down.

                    SIDNEY
          The Deputies took Jill over to
          Kirby's house. I thought it was
          okay. Away from me is always a
          good thing.

Sid's making a joke.    She shuts and locks the door.

                    KATE
          Did you see they got the guy?

                    SIDNEY
          I saw the news. I haven't heard
          from Dewey yet.

                    KATE
          The English teacher. Figures.
          That calls for a glass of wine.
          Whaddya say?

Kate starts for the kitchen.

                    SIDNEY
          You go ahead. I'm gonna turn in.
                                                            76


Kate nods.    Disappointed, but she understands.

INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sidney climbs the stairs and moves down the hall to her
bedroom.

INT. GUEST BEDROOM - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sid enters the bedroom. Grabs her suitcase when her CELL
PHONE RINGS. She grabs it -- sees the CALLER ID is blocked.
She debates. Then, answers it.

                       SIDNEY
                 (into phone)
             Hello?

                       GHOSTFACE
             Hello, Sidney.

Sidney freezes.    Says nothing.   Pure silence.

                       GHOSTFACE (CONT'D)
             Nothing to say?

                       SIDNEY
             You called me. What do you want?

                       GHOSTFACE
             I want you dead.

Sidney says nothing.

                       GHOSTFACE (CONT'D)
             Whaddya say?

                       SIDNEY
             And then what? I die and then
             what?

                       GHOSTFACE
             The movie ends.
                 (silence)
             Tell ya what, I'll have a glass of
             wine while you think it over.

Sidney BOLTS from the room.     She goes racing down the stairs.

INT. KITCHEN - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sidney comes racing into the kitchen to find--

Aunt Kate pouring a glass of wine.    She looks up, startled to
see Sidney so panicked.
                                                               77


                    KATE
          What's wrong?

                    SIDNEY
          We need to get out of here now.

Sidney dials her CELL.   Beat.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          Dewey, Jesus, answer.
              (dials again)
          This is Sidney Prescott, I'm at
          Kate Roberts house, please, hurry.

Just then, Aunt Kate's phone RINGS.   Kate answers it.

                     KATE
              (into phone)
          Hello.
              (then)
          It's for you.

She holds the phone out but Sid won't take it. Instead, she
motions they need get out of the house. "He's in the house."

She points to her ear. "He can hear us." Sid grabs a knife
from the sink. Then, she leads Kate from the kitchen to the
family room to the...

THE GLASS PATIO DOORS

Sidney HITS the porch light to REVEAL--

GHOST FACE standing on the back porch. Kate SCREAMS. They
both turn and race back through the house, through the
kitchen to...

INT. FOYER - ROBERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kate and Sid reach the front door.    Kate UNLOCKS IT and RIPS
IT OPEN to find...

GHOSTFACE ON THE FRONT PORCH.    KNIFE RAISED.   HE STRIKES,
CATCHING KATE IN THE CHEST.

Sidney SCREAMS. As Kate falls back against her.     Sidney
stumbles back against the wall.

GHOSTFACE continues attacking, STABBING Kate repeatedly.

Her body is a shield, protecting Sidney. Several more
STRIKES. Finally, Sidney breaks free -- STRIKES with her own
knife. But--
                                                            78


BLADE HITS BLADE.

The slightest pause. It's just enough for Sidney to flee the
room. Suddenly, POLICE SIRENS can be heard approaching.

INT. KITCHEN - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Sidney races back through the kitchen to the...

INT. FAMILY ROOM - ROBERT'S HOUSE

Sid races to the back patio doors.   She opens them, then
stops when she sees...

GHOSTFACE STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF HER. What? Then,
she realizes -- it's not a person -- only a costume hanging
from the wind chime. It was put there deliberately.

She looks behind her just as...

GHOSTFACE LUNGES -- BARRELS into Sidney. They both go to the
ground, tumbling, rolling across the grass of the back yard.

Sidney is thrown onto her back -- GHOSTFACE atop her.   KNIFE
RAISED. He STRIKES down. Sid blocks it with her arm.

It slices into her -- cutting her forearm.   She SCREAMS.

EXT. FRONT YARD - ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

The Sheriff Jeep pulls into the drive. Dewey and Gale leap
from the car, racing to the house. A SQUAD CAR is right
behind them -- SIRENS BLARING.

EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

Sidney is struggling underneath Ghostface. DEWEY AND GALE
can be heard inside. So does Ghostface -- he looks to the
house -- sees Dewey and others coming...

It's all the time Sid needs - she WHACKS GHOSTFACE. He
tumbles over. Sid manages to crawl away... she gets to her
feet and turns to find...

AN EMPTY YARD. Ghostface has completely disappeared.    A side
gate swings ajar.

THROUGH THE PATIO DOORS

Dewey and Gale race to Sidney.

                    GALE
          Are you okay?
                                                             79


Sidney nods as Dewey races to the side gate.    Gun drawn.   But
the killer is long gone.

EXT. KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A PATROL CAR sits in the driveway of Kirby's house.

INT. PARTROL CAR - NIGHT

Hoss and Perkins sit in the front seat, in mid-convo.

                    PERKINS
          The cops guarding outside the house
          always get it. It's a movie cop
          rule. It sucks to be a cop in a
          movie unless you're Bruce Willis.

                    HOSS
          Not all cops die in movies.

                    PERKINS
          No, but if it's your last day
          before retirement -- you do. Or if
          you're a rookie and just found out
          your wife is pregnant -- you do.
          Or if your partner is better
          looking than you -- you do.

Hoss looks in the rear-view mirror to judge his looks.

                    PERKINS (CONT'D)
          I win that one.

                    HOSS
              (seeing something)
          Who do we have here?

Charlie and Trevor can be seen walking up to the house.
Perkins FLASHES the RED LIGHTS. They stop. Hoss opens the
car door.

                    HOSS (CONT'D)
          I'll be right back.

Perkins starts SNICKERING at him.   Hoss doesn't get it.

                    HOSS (CONT'D)
          What did I say?

Hoss gets out of the car.    Starts for the guys.
                                                            80


INT. FAMILY ROOM - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kirby is going through the MOVIE MENU on the FLAT SCREEN.
Jill is on the couch.

Robbie is in the kitchen making a drink.

                    ROBBIE
          Where's the tequila? I have limes,
          margarita mix and no tequila.

Kirby sends attitude his way.

                    KIRBY
          There's vodka. Drink the goddamn
          vodka and shut up.
              (re: TV)
          What are we watching?

                     ROBBIE
          Zombies.

                     JILL
          No horror. Please? I beg you
          guys. Can we watch a comedy or
          something?

                    ROBBIE
          A zombie comedy. You can't go
          wrong with zombies.

Just then, the DOORBELL RINGS.   Kirby hands Jill the remote.

                    KIRBY
          Why don't you pick? But nothing
          with Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, Ben
          Stiller, Owen Wilson, Jack Black,
          or Will Ferrell.

Kirby goes for the door.

                    KIRBY (CONT'D)
          And it can't be directed by Brett
          Ratner.

INT. FOYER - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kirby races to the door.   Opens it to find Deputy Hoss.

                    HOSS
          You got some visitors.

Charlie and Trevor stand behind him.   Kirby sees Charlie and
points.
                                                             81


                    KIRBY
          He's cool, but I don't about you.
          Does Jill know you're coming?
              (to Hoss)
          Yes, they can come in.

Charlie and Trevor enter.     Kirby stops Trevor.

                    KIRBY (CONT'D)
          You be cool. I don't want any
          bullshit drama. You upset Jill and
          you're out of here.

She leads them into the house.

                    KIRBY (CONT'D)
          This isn't a party. Okay? No
          ruckus. We're very chill tonight.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jill sees Charlie and Trevor enter.    Kirby shrugs.

                    KIRBY
          Just say the word and he's 86.

                    TREVOR
          I can go now. I don't wanna want
          cause a problem.

                       JILL
          It's okay.

Jill and Trevor share a look.

EXT. ROBERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT - LITTLE LATER

A CORONER'S VAN, AMBULANCE, COP CARS, REPORTERS are parked in
front of the house.

Dewey is there.   He speaks to Deputy Hicks.

                    DEWEY
          We have to keep this out of the
          news until we notify Jill.

Deputy Hicks nods, moving up the porch steps.

INT. LIVING ROOM - ROBERT'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A PARAMEDIC bandage Sid's arm.    She's surprisingly calm.
Gale and Dewey are nearby.
                                                         82


                    PARAMEDIC
          We need to get you to the hospital.

                    SIDNEY
          It's okay, I'm fine.

Sid turns to Gale.

                    SIDNEY (CONT'D)
          Where's Jill?

                    GALE
          She's safe.

                    SIDNEY
          I should tell her myself. If
          someone could take me to her?

                    GALE
          We'll have her brought to the
          hospital.

                    SIDNEY
          No, I need to see her now.   Before
          she hears about this.

Gale looks to Deputy Hicks as she passes through.

                    GALE
          Deputy Judy?

Deputy Hicks hates being called that, but plays nice.

                       DEPUTY HICKS
          Yes, Gale.

                    GALE
          Will you see to it that Sidney is
          taken to Jill?

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          Absolutely.

Sidney rises.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Charlie and Robbie are playing a game of pool, in the middle
of a heated discussion.

                    ROBBIE
          You're totally missing my point.
                                                83


                    CHARLIE
          You're missing mine. The original
          STAB was an irreverent self aware
          post-modern deconstruction of the
          horror genre. How do you remake
          it?

                    ROBBIE
          You tap into the zeitgeist and take
          it to the next level.

                    CHARLIE
          And what's the next level?

                    ROBBIE
          Post-post-modern unaware self
          awareness. The genre has evolved.
          The rules have changed.

                    CHARLIE
          No, they haven't. If anything it's
          gone backwards. What rules have
          changed?

                    ROBBIE
          You don't have to be a virgin to
          survive anymore.

Kirby brings them drinks.

                    KIRBY
          That's just an update. You still
          have to be the less slutty one.

                    CHARLIE
          Don't bring her into this.   She
          knows nothing.

                    KIRBY
          I can trivia you under any table.

                    CHARLIE
          Who played Leather Face first?

                    KIRBY
              (instantly)
          Gunnar Hansen.

                    ROBBIE
          Smoke.

Charlie gives Kirby a sexy stare.
                                                           84


                    CHARLIE
          I felt that. Did you feel that?
          That charge that moved between us
          just then. It was there.

Kirby shoots him a look.   "In your dreams."

                    ROBBIE
          New rule. You can kill gay people
          now. You couldn't do that in the
          90's. Gay characters were off
          limits. Total social progress.

                    CHARLIE
          But racial awareness has not
          changed. The black person still
          can't be the killer.

                    ROBBIE
          Yet. But Obama's in office.    He'll
          change that.

                    KIRBY
          The post-modern era of the 90's is
          what triggered these remakes to
          begin with.

                    ROBBIE
          It exposed the cliches so they had
          no choice but to start over.

                    KIRBY
          Because there's no such thing as a
          new idea.

                    CHARLIE
          That is sadistically sad. I refuse
          to believe it. So if you drink and
          do drugs -- will you live?

                    ROBBIE
          You can even say, "I'll be right
          back."

                    KIRBY
          Here's the rule. Do the double
          reverse of every cliche and you'll
          be okay.

IN THE KITCHEN

Trevor makes a drink.   He holds up the bottle of vodka.
                                                              85


                       JILL
          No thanks.

He puts it down.   He'll pass too.    He pours two sodas.

                    TREVOR
          I can't believe Mr. Baker was
          behind it. That's crazy. Do they
          have any idea why?

                    CHARLIE
          Because he's bananas.      You should
          be happy.

                       TREVOR
          Why?

                    CHARLIE
          He busted you good.

                    JILL
          What do you mean?

                    CHARLIE
          Isn't Baker the one who caught you
          in the locker room with the (mimes
          weed) and the (mimes tits)?

Trevor resists ripping his head off.     Charlie knows he's
stirring up trouble.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Gotta pee. Talk amongst
          yourselves.

Charlie exits into the foyer, leaving Trevor and Jill alone.

                    JILL
          Baker is the one who caught you in
          the locker room?

                       TREVOR
          Yeah, so?

                    JILL
          I just didn't know.

                    TREVOR
          It's not like I'm happy about it.

Kirby grabs Jill by the arm and pulls her away.
                                                         86


                    KIRBY
          You come with me.
              (to Trevor)
          We'll be back.

Kirby disappears with Jill. Trevor watches as Kirby leads
Jill upstairs. Trevor goes to the family room. The back
patio doors are wide open.

Robbie has stepped out on the back deck to smoke a cigarette.

EXT. BACK YARD - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Robbie lights up a cigarette. Looks around the back deck.
Patio furniture, built-in barbecue, and bar.

Manicured gardens. Green grass.   A detached guest house in
the rear. Very nicely done.

Robbie goes to the bar and digs around. He finds tequila.
Ah. Jackpot. He pours a shot when CREEAAK! A NOISE takes
his attention.

He looks around.   But sees nothing.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Hoss and Perkins are in the front seat.

                    PERKINS
          I don't know why we have to sit out
          here. They could have invited us
          in.

                    HOSS
          They would polite.   They're kids.

                    PERKINS
          Time to do a perimeter check.

                    HOSS
          I'll go. I hate sitting in this
          car.   I'll be back. Oh wait, I'm
          not supposed to say that -- am I?
          I won't be back.

                    PERKINS
          Tricky area. In this situation
          when there's a good chance you
          could return and find me dead, it
          could go either way.

Hoss gets out of the car.
                                                          87


INT. BEDROOM - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kirby's alternative influenced bedroom.   Jill and Kirby are
on the bed, chatting.

                    KIRBY
          I can send Trevor packing.   He's
          acting all creepy eye.

                    JILL
          I don't think he knows what to say
          to me.

                    KIRBY
          There's something weird going on
          with him. Ya know, like he's...
              (drops it)
          Never mind.

                     JILL
          What?   Say it.

                    KIRBY
          All this STAB talk about remakes.
          If the killer was not only
          following the rules of horror
          movies but the plot of what
          happened before... he's Billy
          Loomis to your Sidney.

                    JILL
          Trevor's not a killer.

                    KIRBY
          I wouldn't guess Mr. Baker to be
          one either. Forget it, I watch too
          many horror movies.

Jill falls back on the bed.   Her mind reeling.

                    KIRBY (CONT'D)
          Can I get you something?

                    JILL
          Do you mind if I just lay here for
          a second?

                    KIRBY
          You take all the time you need.
          I'll be downstairs.

Kirby gets up and goes to the door.
                                                              88


                    KIRBY (CONT'D)
          If you need anything, holla.

Kirby exits, closing the door behind her.

EXT. SIDE YARD - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Deputy Hoss moves around the side of the house. He comes to
a side gate. He checks it. It's locked. He peers over the
fence.

He sees an empty yard.   Everything seems okay.   He starts
back.

EXT. FRONT YARD - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Hoss comes around the side of the house. He crosses the
front yard to the driveway to the PATROL CAR.

He can see Perkins inside. Very still. Is he sleeping?        The
closer Hoss gets, the more worried he becomes.

                     HOSS
          Perkins?

He comes around to the driver's side. Sees clearly that
Perkins is slumped over the wheel. He races to him.
Suddenly Perkins lifts up, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY.

                    PERKINS
          You're too easy.

Hoss wants to smack him but he's STABBED IN THE CHEST. It
comes fast and quick. FROM BEHIND. The KNIFE PENETRATES
DEEP. Hoss CRIES OUT. Drops to the ground revealing...

THE GHOST FACE BEHIND HIM. Perkins reaches for his gun, but
he's too slow. The GHOST FACE RUSHES HIM -- IN ONE SWIFT
MOVE...

THE KNIFE SLICES HIS NECK OPEN -- THE CAROTID ARTERY ERUPTS.

Death is quick for both men. The GHOST FACE KILLER works
fast. He pops the trunk. He's going to hide the bodies.

INT. KITCHEN - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE SECURITY MONITORS -- GHOSTFACE is seen closing
the trunk and starting back toward the house -- disappearing
from view.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal an...

AN EMPTY KITCHEN
                                                             89


Several eerie moments and then Kirby enters.      Looks around.

                    KIRBY
          Where is everybody?

She peeks into the family room.    Sees the patio doors open.

                      KIRBY (CONT'D)
          Hello?

She goes back to the fridge.    Opens it.   Grabs a water.   When
he closes it...

CHARLIE IS THERE.   Kirby doesn't jump at all.

                    CHARLIE
          You were supposed to jump.

                    KIRBY
          The refrigerator door is no-scare
          for me. It's right up there with
          the medicine cabinet mirror.

                    CHARLIE
          Now, see the medicine cabinet gets
          me every time. It's the shower
          curtain that's lame.

                    KIRBY
          Or the cat through the widow.
          Meoooow.

Kirby makes a HISSING CAT SOUND.

                    CHARLIE
          We really should hook up.    Who else
          gets you better than me?

He's getting too close.   Kirby pushes by him.

                    KIRBY
          Where did everyone go?    Where's
          Robbie?

Kirby looks to the family room.

                    CHARLIE
          Maybe, he left. Wanna watch a
          movie?

Kirby considers it.

                    KIRBY
          You promise not to rub all over me?
                                                           90


                    CHARLIE
          I can do that. Whaddya want to
          watch?

Charlie goes to the remote -- starts to key up the ON SCREEN
LIBRARY.

                    KIRBY
          Anything. But no torture porn,
          shaky cam, docu-horror, manga-
          techno, 3D or PG-13 shit-ola.

                    CHARLIE
          Soul mates.

Kirby shakes her head.    Never.

INT. KIRBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jill lies down, takes the pillow and makes herself
comfortable. But, she's restless. She sits up.

Goes to the window. Looks out. Sees the Detective's car
outside. A NOISE behind her. She turns and looks.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jill steps out into the hall. HEARS music from below. Looks
over the bannister to the FOYER. Sees no one. She goes back
into Kirby's bedroom. Moves to the adjoining bathroom. She
opens up the MEDICINE CABINET.

Grabs some Tylenol. CLOSES IT. No one's behind her.      She
pops them and sips some water. Returns to...

KIRBY'S BEDROOM

To find a FIGURE STANDING IN THE DARK.   Jill JUMPS.   From the
shadows emerges Trevor.

                    JILL
          What are you doing here?

                    TREVOR
          I was leaving. I wanted to say
          good-night.

Jill is nervous being alone with him.

                    JILL
          Good-night.

                       TREVOR
          That's it?
                                                         91


                    JILL
          I think you should quit while
          you're ahead.

                     TREVOR
          Are you sure you wanna be alone? I
          could stay for a while. We could
          just talk.

Jill thinks about it.

                    JILL
          Not tonight, Trevor.

                    TREVOR
          I'm sorry about Olivia.

Jill nods, appreciates it. He gives her one last look and
exits. Once he's gone, Jill falls back on the bed. SIGHS.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kirby grabs some chips and drinks. She glances over to the
SECURITY MONITORS. Something catches her eye. She sees
SOMEONE in the back yard as they quickly disappear into the
GUEST HOUSE.

She starts for the patio doors.

EXT. BACK PORCH - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kirby emerges from the patio doors.   Charlie follows,
curious.

                    CHARLIE
          What are you doing?

                    KIRBY
          I saw someone on the monitor.

                    CHARLIE
          Are you sure?

                       KIRBY
          No.

                    CHARLIE
          Was it a small Asian girl with dark
          hair?

Kirby LAUGHS.

                    KIRBY
          Will you go look?
                                                         92


                      CHARLIE
            You're kidding right? I'm a lot of
            things, brave is not one of them.

                      KIRBY
            For God's sake.

Kirby crosses the yard.

                      CHARLIE
            I don't feel guilty.   Or less of a
            man.

Whatever.   Kirby crosses to the...

EXT. GUEST HOUSE - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A small guest cottage on the rear of the property. The front
door is made of glass but's it's completely dark inside.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

Kirby enters the guest house. Her hand feels around for the
light switch. She CLICKS on the light. Looks around. It's
empty. She goes to the bedroom. Looks inside.

She sees SOMEBODY on the bed. She moves closer.   It's
Robbie. He lays incredibly still.

                       KIRBY
            Robbie?   What are you doing?

Just then, he rises.    YAWNING.

                      ROBBIE
            I'm sorry, Kirby. What did I
            drink? Three beer?

                      KIRBY
            You had some vodka too.

                      ROBBIE
            I was thinking about Olivia, ya
            know. Having a moment.

                      KIRBY
            C'mon, you shouldn't be out here.

Robbie gets up and they both head out.

EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

Together they cross back to the house.
                                                            93


INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

Robbie and Kirby enter.    Once again, no one is there.   The
entire room is empty.

                    KIRBY
          What is going on?    Where did
          Charlie go?

                    ROBBIE
          Where's Jill and Trevor?

                    KIRBY
          I don't know.
              (calling out)
          Charlie?

Kirby is closing and locking the patio doors when the PHONE
RINGS.

                    ROBBIE
          I'll get it.

Robbie races to the kitchen counter.   Grabs the phone.

                     ROBBIE (CONT'D)
          Hello?

                    GHOSTFACE
          You're dead.

                     ROBBIE
          What?

Just then, GHOSTFACE EXPLODES OUT OF THE PANTRY. He attacks
with the KNIFE. It strikes Robbie in the chest. Then, a
SLIT across the throat. He doesn't utter a sound.

Kirby turns from the door just in time to see Robbie's
lifeless body drop out of view.

GHOST FACE turns his attention to Kirby.   She SCREAMS.

                     KIRBY
          Noooooo.

She takes off, running out the patio doors into...

THE BACK YARD

She runs back to the...
                                                            94


INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

She races inside and shuts the door, locking it. Then, she
races to the SLIDING GLASS DOORS that overlook the back yard.
She makes sure all entries are locked.

INT. FRONT YARD - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A SQUAD CAR pulls up in front. Gale and Deputy Hicks get
out. Sidney immediately starts for the front door.

                    DEPUTY HICKS
          Hold up, Ms. Prescott.

Sidney starts up the walk while Hicks goes to the PATROL CAR
in the driveway. Hicks shines a FLASHLIGHT on the empty car.
She aims it to the door and cement. It illuminates blood.

                       DEPUTY HICKS (CONT'D)
          Oh my God.

Sidney sees the look on Deputy Hick's face.

                       SIDNEY
          Jill!!!!

Sidney bolts for the house.     She races up the porch steps and
inside the house.

INT. FOYER - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sidney races into the house. She HEARS a NOISE from
upstairs, quickly contemplates, but then a NOISE from the
kitchen.

Sidney enters the kitchen, sees Robbie's body crumpled on the
kitchen floor. She grabs quickly searches the draws for a
weapon. She finds a KITCHEN KNIFE.

She looks to the open patio doors.    Goes for them.

EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

Sidney sees Kirby at the window of the guest house. Sidney
goes for her. Kirby unlocks the door and races towards.
Relieved to see her.

                    SIDNEY
          Where's Jill?

                       KIRBY
          Upstairs.
                                                            95


                       SIDNEY
          C'mon...

Just then, Charlie emerges from the house, looking really
scared.

                    CHARLIE
          Robbie's dead.

Sidney doesn't know what to think of him.   She holds out the
knife.

                       SIDNEY
          Stay back.

                     CHARLIE
          Why?   What did I do?

                       KIRBY
          He's okay.

                    SIDNEY
          Are you sure? There's blood on his
          hands.

Kirby sees the blood on his hands.

                    KIRBY
          Why do you have blood on your
          hands, Charlie?

Charlie holds up his hands.

                    CHARLIE
          I tried to help Robbie.

Charlie is honestly scared out of his mind. He takes a step
towards them when Sidney shields Kirby, protecting her.

Kirby races back inside the guest house. Sid is right behind
her. They lock the door. Charlie follows them.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Please. I haven't done anything.
          We gotta get out of here.

INT. FOYER - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Deputy Hicks enters. Gun drawn. A LIGHT at the top of the
stairs takes her attention. It's followed by a CLOSING DOOR.

                       DEPUTY HICKS
          Sidney?
                                                              96


Hicks, against all better judgement, climbs the stairs.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

Charlie stands just outside the glass doors. He pleads with
them. While Sidney dials her CELL PHONE. She's calling Jill
But there's no answer.

                    CHARLIE
          C'mon, open up.

He BEATS on the glass window.    His face is panicked.

                    KIRBY
          Go away, Charlie.

                    CHARLIE
          Hurry, we need to go...

Kirby is freaking out.   She fights back her emotion.

Just then, Kirby and Sidney see GHOST FACE appears behind
Charlie. She realizes she was wrong.

                    SIDNEY
          Watch out...

Charlie turns just as the KNIFE STRIKES.   He ducks, races
away, back into the yard.

The GHOST FACE goes after him.    They disappear from view.

Kirby moves to the next window, just misses them.   The
windows of the room only face the side yard.

She goes into the next room.

INT. BEDROOM - GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

It's a small bedroom that opens up onto the whole back yard.
Two huge glass doors look out onto the yard and pool.
Suddenly, the LIGHTS GO OUT. The back yard is plunged into
darkness. Shit. What now?

INT. KIRBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jill sits up on the bed. HEARS a noise from the hallway. She
goes to the door and opens it. Peeks out. She sees a SHADOW
dance across the wall.

She steps into...
                                                           97


INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING

Jill moves down the hall. There's an open doorway at the
end. Jill goes to it. Peers in. She sees Deputy Hicks
standing with a GHOST FACE MASK in her hand.

Hicks sees her -- pulls her gun.    Jill throws her hands up,
frightened.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Sidney backs away from the glass.   Just then, her CELL PHONE
RINGS. She answers it.

                    SIDNEY
              (into cell)
          What?

Kirby watches Sidney. Terrified.

                    GHOST FACE
              (from phone)
          Are you ready?

                    SIDNEY
              (into phone)
          For what?

                    GHOST FACE
          To play a game.

Sidney turns angry.

                    SIDNEY
          I'm not playing, asshole.

Sidney hangs up.   A shivering Kirby stares at her.

                    KIRBY
          Should you have hung up on him?

Just then, BACK YARD LIGHTS flood the yard.

Both Sidney and Kirby go to the glass doors and look out
onto...

EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

In the middle of the yard, directly facing the GUEST HOUSE,
Charlie sits in a patio chair. Bound by electrical tape. It
covers his mouth, his arms, and legs.

He STRUGGLES to free himself, RIPPING and PULLING -- but it's
impossible.
                                                            98


INSIDE THE GUEST HOUSE

Kirby CRIES OUT.   She's frighteningly sober.     CRAZED.

                    KIRBY
          Don't... oh god, don't, please...

She starts for the door when Sidney grabs her.

                    SIDNEY
          No, don't...

And then the phone RINGS.      Sid answers.

                     GHOST FACE
          Let's try this again.
              (then)
          You know how this works. First
          question. Are you ready?

No, Sid's not ready.    She's not ready at all.

                    SIDNEY
          No, I'm not ready.

A shaking, terrified, Kirby stares at Charlie in the yard.
Their eyes meet. He's begging for his life. Kirby turns to
Sidney, finding courage.

                       KIRBY
          I'm ready.

Sidney puts her cell on SPEAKER so Kirby can hear.

                    GHOST FACE
          Easy warm-up: Name the killer in
          STAB--

                    KIRBY

          Billy Loomis, Stu Macher, Mickey
          Altieri, Debbie Salt aka Nancy
          Loomis, Roman Bridger.

Kirby's brain is crazily focused.     She knows her shit.

                    MAN'S VOICE
          Name the first victim in STAB?

                    KIRBY
          Easy. Casey-- oh, wait, no it was
          her boyfriend, in the back yard--.
                                                           99


                    SIDNEY
          No, it's a trick question.
              (into phone)
          Maureen Prescott was the first
          victim a year earlier.

Kirby nods.   Yes, of course.

                    KIRBY
          TRILOGY OF TERROR.

Kirby's an ace with trivia. Sidney watches her, impressed.
Then, she goes to Charlie in the yard -- she still holds the
knife. Sid quietly opens the door when--

                    GHOST FACE
          Sidney, you step out that door and
          I will slit him ear to ear.

Sid closes the door back.

IN THE BACK YARD

Charlie is watching, horrified, his life in their hands.

                    GHOST FACE (CONT'D)
          What current remake featured--

Kirby goes nuts, trying to figure it out.

Shit. Kirby is mouthing "9? 10?..." She's counting it out
on her fingers. She has no idea. She's a nervous wreck.
Sidney tries to help.

                    SIDNEY
          Go with one. Nine works.

          Wait. In the FINAL CHAPTER we

          killed in the flashback in `58 and
          Jason drowned the summer before,
          `57, so born in `46, drowned in `57

          yes!!!

Kirby leaps up.    With mad and crazy euphora.

IN THE BACK YARD

Charlie is relieved.   Sort of.

INSIDE THE GUEST HOUSE

Sid looks around the yard.   It's deadly quiet.

          Charlie get to the house. Okay?

A petrified Kirby can only nod.

IN THE YARD

Charlie watches the, curious as to hwat they're up to.
Sidney unlatches the door. Looks to the left, to the right.

Slowly, she steps out.   Kirb joins her.

ON CHARLIE -- Scared.    Worried.   Hopeful.

Kirby looks at the back yard.   To the main house.   There's no
sign of anyone. Anywhere.

                     KIRBY
          I won.   Didn't I?

IN THE YARD

Casey and Sid race to Charlie. They rips at the tape around
his arms. All the while, looking around into the shadows of
the yard, knowing the KILLER could be anywhere.

          I won, Charlie. I won.

She rips the tap of his mouth, then arms...

                    CHARLIE
          Oh god, hurry...

                    SIDNEY
          Finish this and get outta her. I
          gotta find Jill.

Sidney starts for the main house while Kirby continues
freeing Charlie.

With his hands free, Charlie starts helping. He rips his
legs free from the chair. He rises up. He grabs Kirby,
kisses her for saving his life.

                    KIRBY
          We have to hurry.

                    CHARLIE
          Yeah, just one thing.

She looks at Charlie -- his expression turns. Then, she sees
the KNIFE he reaches for, hidden in the chair. The next
moment happens fast -- AS CHARLIE STABS HER WITH THE KNIFE.

It SLICES INTO KIRBY'S stomach.     She stumbles back.
                                                           103


                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          How did you fucking know 11? You
          fucking cow, you were supposed to
          miss that one. Goddammit.

Kirby looks at him with childlike innocence.    Then, the pain
and shock follow.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Yeah, you win alright. You fucking
          prick tease. You win death.

He STABS her again -- FURIOUS AT HER. She COUGHS UP, unable
to speak -- a look of stunned horror. He STABS HER SEVERAL
MORE TIMES -- QUICK JABS. Kirby manages a SCREAM.

Sidney turns in time to see Kirby drop to the ground.   As
Charlie meets Sid's stare.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Okay, you look genuinely surprised.
          I can explain.

He takes a step towards Sid.    She stumbles back inside the
house. He starts for her.

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Sid locks the doors.   Races through the house to the...

INT. FOYER - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

She rips the front door open as GHOST FACE LUNGES AT HER,
waiting for her.

Sid flees to the only place she can -- upstairs.

INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT

Sid races up the stairs and down the hall.    GHOST FACE is
fast on her heels.

INT. KIRBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sidney races inside Kirby's bedroom.   She locks the doors,
runs to the bathroom. She shuts it.    Locks it. Then...

SHE HEARS SOMETHING. It comes from behind the shower
curtain. Sidney reaches for the curtain -- pulls it aside to
find...

TREVOR -- HE REACHES OUT. GRABS HER. Sidney SCREAMS.
KNOCKS HIM OVER. Then, she moves fast. Sid rips the
bathroom door and bolts.
                                                           104


Sid runs to Kirby's bedroom door. She opens -- GHOST FACE is
before her. Sidney STRIKES with her kitchen knife.

It's catches GHOST FACE'S ARM.    He flinches.   It's enough for
Sidney to squeak by.

INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING

Sid races down the hall. She gets to the stair case.     Looks
down to see Charlie climbing up -- knife in hand.

Sidney runs down the hallway to an open doorway.    She goes
inside and trips instantly over something.

She comes face to face with Deputy Hicks. Sidney is on top
of her, staring directly into Hicks' cold, dead eyes.

SIDNEY SCREAMS.    Rolls off her. Turns to see -- GHOST FACE
enter the room.    Sidney looks around. There's no where else
for her to run.

Slowly, GHOST FACE approaches.

                     GHOST FACE
           What's the matter, Sid? You look
           like you've seen a ghost.

And with that, the Ghost Face removes its mask, revealing
Jill underneath. She sports a wicked smile as she slips out
of the costume.

Sidney's face drops to the floor.

                     JILL
           Yep, it's me. Surprised.

                      SIDNEY
           Jill.   No...

Sidney tries to make a break for it.   But she comes nose to
nose with a loaded gun.

                     JILL
           I've got the Deputy's gun. I'm
           dying to shoot it. I'm so sick of
           the knife thing. Now, get up.

Beat.   As Sidney does as told.

INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT

Charlie is dragging Trevor's body to the top of the stairs.
It's obvious now that his feet have been bound and he's been
seriously injured. His shirt is bloody red.
                                                           105


                    CHARLIE
          C'mon, Trevor, buddy, this might
          hurt a little.

Charlie sits him up at the top of the stairs and then pushes
him. His body goes TUMBLING to the body.

He lands with a THUD. And a CRACK. Something broke. He lay
at the bottom of the stairs -- CRYING OUT IN PAIN. Charlie
trots down to join him.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          It looks like you broke your leg.
          That sucks.

Charlie PRESSES down on it.    Trevor SCREAMS IN AGONY.

                    TREVOR
          You fucker...

Jill appears, leading Sidney down the stairs.

                    CHARLIE
              (to Jill)
          You asked her the easy questions.
          Didn't you use my list? I put the
          harder ones at the top. Why did
          you skip?

                       JILL
          It's done.     Can we move on?

                    CHARLIE
          Can we do him yet? With DNA
          testing, we're good with time line.

Jill turns the gun to Trevor -- without flinching.   She
shoots him in the forehead. He drops over dead.

                    SIDNEY
          Jesus... why...

Jill turns the gun back on Sidney.

INT. KITCHEN - KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jill and Charlie lead Sid into the kitchen where Robbie lay
dead on the floor.

                    CHARLIE
          You got it figured out yet, Sid?
          In keeping with our remake theme,
          Trevor and Robbie are this
          generation's--
                                                         106


                    SIDNEY
          Billy and Stu.

                    JILL
          And we're the innocent victims.

                    CHARLIE
          We're Sidney and Randy. And we get
          to go to college and have a sequel.
          But this time -- Randy gets the
          girl.

Charlie moves to Jill -- she lets him kiss her. You get the
sense she tolerates Charlie. They break. He smiles.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          You did real good. You're the
          perfect victim.

Jill can't hide it.   She's full of exhilaration.

                    JILL
          I was so believable today. I told
          so many lies I actually believed
          them. I was born for this.

Jill's true colors start to take shape. She's a deeply
troubled sociopath. She looks to Sidney.

                    JILL (CONT'D)
          C'mon, let's face it. I've had
          enough practice. Do you know what
          it was like growing up in the this
          family? In this town?

                     CHARLIE
          Her mother was a slut bag whore
          just like your mother. Sisters. I
          made out with her mom once. She
          got drunk and slipped me the tongue
          one night.

                    JILL
          Drunk bitch.

                    SIDNEY
          You crazy fucks...

Just then, the PHONE RINGS.

                    JILL
          Watch this.
                                                          107


Jill races for it. Grabs it haphazardly and sinks into a
MASTER PERFORMANCE OF HYSTERIA AND FEAR.

                    JILL (CONT'D)
              (into phone)
          Oh my God, help me. He's trying to
          kill me. He killed Sidney... Help.

Jill hangs up.   Back to calm and poise.    To Charlie.

                    JILL (CONT'D)
          C'mon, we need to get on with it.
          They'll be here soon.

He raises his arms -- as Jill holds the KNIFE.    She's going
to stab him.

                    JILL (CONT'D)
          I'm going to do this hard.   It
          can't be tentative.

                    CHARLIE
          C'mon, baby, let's do this old
          school, like Billy and Stu. It's a
          remake, baby.
              (ala Chinatown)
          No, it's a sequel. It's a remake,
          sequel, remake, sequel, sister,
          daughter, sequel...

Jill stabs him. She gets him DIRECTLY in the heart. He
drops to his knees. Instant pain. But his face registers
confusion too.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          That's not the way we rehearsed
          it...

He doubles over, bleeding. She takes the opportunity --
STRIKES him again. And, in this moment, he realizes he's
been played and betrayed.

                    JILL
          There's been a change of plans.
          The problem with you, Charlie.
          It's always been about killing
          Sidney Prescott. My plan is a
          little bigger. I'm going to become
          her.

And with that, Jill stabs him again. Charlie can't believe
it. He's stunned and shocked. He falls back, crumbling to
the floor. Still. As Jill looks down at him with a glimmer
of diabolical glee.
                                                              108


A quick kick of her foot.    His body doesn't move.   He's dead.

                    SIDNEY
          How did you turn into this?

                    JILL
          Nothing is ever what it seems.
          Your words, Sidney. I've always
          been this. You know what it's like
          growing up related to you? All you
          hear is Sidney this, Sidney that,
          Sidney, Sidney...You were always so
          fucking special. Now it's my turn.

Jill takes the knife.

                     JILL (CONT'D)
          And now you have to die.    Those are
          the rules.

                    SIDNEY
          What rules?

                    JILL
          There's only room for one lead.
          Let's face it, Sid, you're ingenue
          days are over.

Jill STABS Sidney with the knife. She GASPS in pain. Jill
STABS her again quickly. This one WRACKS Sid's body. She
drops to her knees. Sidney's eyes roll back in her head.
Everything goes slow-motion.

                    JILL (CONT'D)
          Apropos. Finally, what should of
          happened 15 years ago.

Sidney falls to the floor. Jill watches as Sidney draws her
last breath. Sad. Tragic. Epic. All at once.

Jill springs into action.    She's well rehearsed.

She kneels next to Charlie's body. She takes his limp hand
and claws at her own face, with careful attention to his
fingers. She's securing her DNA under his nails.

She then makes sure his class ring is facing out on his
middle finger and proceeds to PUNCH herself with his limp
hand.

It doesn't really create the desired effect.      She tries
BACKHANDING herself. That works better.
                                                           109


Quick and fast, she BASHES herself several times. It hurts
like hell. She CRIES out but continues until she hears a
CRACK.

BLOOD SPEWS FORTH. It's broken. Jill SOBS in genuine pain.
But, she's not done. She leans down closer to Charlie's
body. Takes his other hand and places it on her head,
clamping down on her hair.

She takes a BEAT to prepare herself. Then, YANKS AWAY.
RIPPING a large CLUMP OF HAIR from her own scalp.

Jill SCREAMS in pain.    That fucking hurt.

She throws Charlie's hand to the floor -- hair clutched in
his dead fingers. Then, she sees GALE begin to stir again.

Jill moves fast. She stands up and quickly moves -- racing
backwards, free falling into...

THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE

It SHATTERS to pieces. Jill lay there engulfed by the
table's frame. GLASS is everywhere. Beat. She attempts to
rise -- it takes a few tries. As she CRIES OUT. She's truly
hurting now.

                    JILL (CONT'D)
          Help me... Somebody help me...

Glass shards stick out of her arm, back and shoulders.   Blood
streaks her arms. Jill tries to get up, but can't...

She lay there CRYING ... WHIMPERING ...

As Jill lay there, hurt and bleeding. Her face full of
helpless innocence. The moment DISSOLVES TO:

EXT. KIRBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

The aftermath. Flashing SQUAD CARS and AMBULANCES. The
carnage is overwhelming. POLICE barricade the property.
MEDIA gawk from a distance.

On a stretcher in the back of an AMBULANCE, Jill's wounds are
being treated. Her shirt has been cut up the back side, and
little pieces of glass are being picked from her flesh.

We reveal Dewey standing alone, staring guiltily at this
horror show. Eyes full of tears.

                    GALE
          This wasn't your fault.
                                                          110


Dewey doesn't speak.    He's terribly shaken.

                    GALE (CONT'D)
          At least Jill's okay.

Dewey silently nods.    Gale hugs him tighter.

AT THE AMBULANCE - MOMENTS LATER

Jill sits in the back, weakly talking to Dewey.   Laying out
her cover story.

                    JILL
          Charlie told me he and Trevor had
          planned this since last year. He
          said they were Billy and Stu all
          over again. Except that this was
          going to be the reboot of all time.

In the B.G., NEWS REPORTERS and PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS shout:

                     PRESS
          JILL!   JILL! Look OVER HERE!!

Jill timidly squints at Dewey.    A helpless little girl face.

                    JILL
          What should I do?

                    DEWEY
          I gotta warn you. For the rest of
          your life, they're never gonna
          leave you alone.

                    JILL
              (fake overwhelmed)
          Maybe I'll just... give them one
          picture. So they'll go away...

Wincing, hamming up the pain, Jill "trembles" and lifts
herself to her feet with Dewey's assistance. Then -- she
steps around the edge of the ambulance.

FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! FLASH! The yard BLAZES WHITE
WITH CAMERA FLASHES, like Yankee Stadium lit up at night.

Just then, an OFFICER    announces from inside the house --

                    OFFICER
          We have one alive.     A woman.

Dewey and Gale light up with this news.
                             111


                    DEWEY
          You mean Sidney?

AND CRASH AND BURN.
