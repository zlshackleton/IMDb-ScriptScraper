Our fictional game show is called Can't Stop the Quiz. The
gameplay will become evident throughout the film, but just to
explain it up top for clarity:

Can't Stop the Quiz (aka CSQ) is a nightly game show that airs
live Monday-Friday at 7pm. It's been on since 1985, and hosted by
Terry McTeer for the entirety of its run. Here's how it works:

Round 1: "The Blitz" - three contestants (one of whom is the
returning champion) compete in a rapid-fire trivia blitz. Terry
asks questions, they buzz in to answer. They go through as many
questions as they can in five minutes. The prize money gets higher
every ten questions, so for the first ten questions are worth
$100, second ten are worth $200, etc.

The top two scoring players advance to:

Round 2: "The Head to Head" - the two contestants face off against
each other. Players take turns selecting a category for the other
player. They are given a sub-category, and thirty seconds to list
as many things in that sub-category as they can. (For example, the
category is "Geography" and the sub-category is "Countries with
Green In Their Flag"). Answers are worth $500. If a player lists
all possible answers and still has time remaining, they get a
bonus of $1000/second left on the clock.

Round 3: "The Coin Flip" - the players flip a giant coin to
determine if the Final Round will be "SAY IT!", where contestants
must say the answer, or "SHOW IT!", where the contestants bring a
partner on stage and must act out the answers while their partner
guesses.

    CLOSE ON: An OLD, BULKY TV SET. TERRY MCTEER (warm,
    approachable, wearing a suit and bow tie) is on screen.

              It's seven o'clock on a weeknight,
              which can only mean one thing. It's
              time for Can't Stop the Quiz.

    YOUNG ANNE (6), a classic nerd, sits on the floor in front of
    the TV, completely rapt.

    CHYRON: 1996

    ON TV: The CAN'T STOP THE QUIZ THEME SONG plays as a CHEESY
    ANIMATED BRAIN dances across the screen.

    Anne bops her head to the beat, dancing along with the brain.

                        TERRY (CONT'D)
              I'm your host Terry McTeer. Let's
              meet today's contestants.

    YOUNG JENNY (16, cool, stylish) walks into the living room,
    talking on the phone. She plops down on the couch.

                        YOUNG JENNY
              Oh my god! You made out with David
              Zelman??? Ashley is gonna kill you!
                                                                      *
    Anne, annoyed, tries to tune out Jenny and focus on the TV.

                        TERRY
              May I have five minutes on the
              clock please?

    The Brain places a countdown clock onscreen.

                        TERRY (CONT'D)
              And your time. Starts. Now!
                  (reading quickly)
              What is the lightest element on the
              periodic table?

    A contestant, DENISE, buzzes in.

                        TERRY
              Correct. What is the deepest
              freshwater lake in the world?

    Anne's focus is interrupted by yelling from upstairs --

                        THEIR DAD (O.S.)
              You lost six hundred dollars?!

    Their dad starts angrily yelling in KOREAN.

                        THEIR MOM (O.S.)
              Stop with the Korean! How would you
              like it if I yelled in Chinese?!

    She starts yelling in CANTONESE. It's a multilingual
    cacophony. Jenny eyes Anne, feeling bad for her. She turns up
    the volume on the TV, without pausing her conversation:

                        YOUNG JENNY
              No they're still hooking up! They
              went to third base YESTERDAY!

    Their dad storms down the stairs, on a tear.

                        THEIR DAD
                  (in Korean)
              I can't do this! You ruin
              everything! I won't let you drag me
              down anymore!

    He storms out, slamming the door behind him. Jenny stares at
    the door, dumbfounded. A heavy beat. Then:

                        YOUNG JENNY
              Mom! Dad just said a bunch of stuff
              in Korean and left!

    Anne, desperate to escape, stays focused on the TV. We hear a
    GAME SHOW SOUND CUE and CUT TO:

    INT. SAME LIVING ROOM - THREE YEARS LATER - NIGHT

    9-YEAR-OLD ANNE watches CSQ. Terry is on screen, wearing a
    different bowtie, but otherwise looking mostly the same.
    THREE DIFFERENT CONTESTANTS at the podiums.

                        TERRY
              And that's the end of The Blitz!
              Wow you guys are smart!

                                                          3.
                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Carl, I can't believe you knew the
          name of that comet. That was
          incredible! You almost knocked my
          bowtie off. But luckily it's tied
          on tight. With a shoelace knot.
          Little extra learning for you.

Terry wiggles his bowtie.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          When we return, Michael and Carl
          will compete in the Head to Head!
          Don't go anywhere. I know I won't.

Anne happily mouths along with Terry -- "I know I won't." As
the TV switches to an AGGRESSIVELY 1999 COMMERCIAL --

19-YEAR-OLD JENNY enters, carrying a bowl of noodles and an
egg, followed by their mom, CRYSTAL. As Crystal talks, Jenny
puts the bowl in front of Anne.

                    CRYSTAL
          Your cousin Jin just got into
          Harvard medical school! And you're
          dropping out?! It's bad enough you
          go to community college --

                    19-YEAR-OLD JENNY
          Where else was I supposed to go?!
          There's no money!

Jenny is distracted by yelling at Crystal, and cracks the egg
not over the bowl of noodles. Anne moves the bowl to catch
the egg while Jenny and Crystal continue to argue --

                    CRYSTAL
          You should have been smarter and
          gotten a scholarship! But no,
          you're too stupid!

                    19-YEAR-OLD JENNY
          I don't need school! I'm going to
          be an ACTRESS!!!

Anne flinches at the yelling. She takes her bowl of noodles
and scoots a little closer to the TV.

                    CRYSTAL
          You can't make money as an actress!
                           Blue (05/18/2022)                    4.

                        19-YEAR-OLD JENNY
              Tell that to Julia Roberts!!! And
              it's not about the money! This is
              my dream! This is my destiny!

                        CRSYTAL
              Destiny. Bah.

    She dismissively waves it off and goes for the door.

                        19-YEAR-OLD JENNY
              Did you just "bah" my destiny?!?!

                        CRYSTAL
              You're making me crazy. I'm going
              to the casino.

                        19-YEAR-OLD JENNY
              Oh great. Have fun LOSING ALL OUR
              MONEY!

    Crystal storms out. Jenny runs upstairs. Anne focuses back on
    the TV. We hear a GAME SHOW SOUND CUE and CUT TO:

3                                                                   3
    INT. SAME LIVING ROOM - THREE YEARS LATER - NIGHT

    The house is quiet and still, Can't Stop the Quiz on TV. 12-
    YEAR-OLD ANNE is on the couch. Terry is on screen, wearing a
    different bowtie, otherwise looking more or less the same.

                        TERRY
              Danton, which category will you
              choose for AJ?

    Danton looks at a screen of categories.

                        DANTON
              Hmm. How about Geography?

                        TERRY
              Geography! AJ, you will have to
              list for us...
                  (it appears on screen)
              Countries on the Equator! Ooh,
              that's a tough one. Your time
              starts now!

    22-YEAR-OLD JENNY runs into the living room, SO excited.
                          Yellow (05/27/2022)                    5.

                        22-YEAR-OLD JENNY
              I made it to the final round of
              auditions for The Real World!!!!! I
              have to go to LA tomorrow to meet
              with the producers!!! AHHH!!!

                        12-YEAR-OLD ANNE
              But what about your puppy?

    She gestures to the corner, where a little pen is set up, and
    an unbelievably adorable FAWN PUG PUPPY sits.

                        22-YEAR-OLD JENNY
              Oh yeah. Can you take care of Mr.
              Linguini?
                  (off Anne's look)
              Annie, seriously, it'll be good for
              you. You could use a friend. And
              it's just until I get back!

    Jenny runs upstairs. Anne looks at the adorable puppy, not
    thrilled about dogs in general. A CSQ SOUND CUE cuts to:

4                                                                    4
    INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT

    ANNE (30s, risk-adverse introvert) sits on her couch, with a
    now ancient Mr. Linguini curled up next to her. CSQ is on TV.
    Terry, now with white hair, but otherwise mostly the same,
    except for - as always - a different bow tie, is on screen:

                        TERRY
              What an incredible game! I learned
              so much. I had no idea pineapple is
              a berry. That blows my mind.
                  (to camera)
              Join us tomorrow for another night
              of fast facts and live learning!
              I'm Terry McTeer and I'll be right--

    He jumps to his center mark where he begins every show.

                        TERRY (CONT'D)
              -- here. Have a good night!

    Terry does a little salute. Anne does it back to him. She
    looks completely content, comforted by her favorite show.

    INT. ANNE'S CUBICLE - PRESENT DAY

    Anne sits at her desk in a very drab, very safe office.

    Anne inputs data into a massive spreadsheet. She's in the
    zone, eyes darting between two computer monitors, fingers
    flying over the keys.

    An ALARM goes off on her phone. She checks it. It's a
    reminder: Time to walk around the office so you don't get
    blood clots and die. Anne gets up.

6                                                                    6
    INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - DAY

    Anne makes a cup of tea at the water cooler area. Two co-
    workers, TRAV (slightly douchey), and MARGE (unintentionally
    rude) walk up.

                        TRAV
              Oh shit does this mean there's
              gonna be birthday cake later?

                        MARGE
                  (disappointed)
              No, she asked for pie.

                  (way too mad)
              Fuck!

    Trav turns, sees Anne by the water cooler, and JUMPS.

                        TRAV (CONT'D)
              JESUS! You snuck up on me!

    Anne looks confused. She's just been standing there.

    INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - LATER

    Anne scans documents at the copy machine. Trav and other co-
    workers are gathered around CINDY as Marge brings over a pie
    with candles in it. Anne watches the party from afar.

    EXT. ANNE AND FRANCINE'S DUPLEX- DAY

    Anne pulls into the driveway of a duplex. As she gets out of
    her gray Toyota Corrolla, FRANCINE (older, grumpy) shuffles
    out from her front door.
                                                               7.

                        FRANCINE
              Anne! The ups man has done it
              again. He left one of your packages
              in front of my door.

    Francine points to an Amazon box on her doorstep. Anne grabs
    the box and struggles to lift it. It's cumbersome.

                        ANNE
              Sorry about that, Francine.

                        FRANCINE
              If I haven't ordered a package,
              then I'm not expecting one to be on
              my doorstep. Are you listening?

                        ANNE
              I am, but I'm in a hurry --

                        FRANCINE
              What happens if I leave the house
              and there's an unexpected package
              on my doorstep? I trip and I fall
              and I die. That's what happens.
                  (dead serious)
              The ups man is trying to kill me.

                        ANNE
              U.P.S.

                        FRANCINE
              Huh?

                        ANNE
              It's U.P.S. Not ups.

                        FRANCINE
              Well whoever it is.

    Anne goes inside.

9                                                                  9
    INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

    Anne walks in. Her place is bland and functional. The only
    personal effects are books, and there are lots of them.

    Mr. Linguini is asleep on the couch, snoring so loudly.

                        ANNE
              Hi Mr. Linguini!
                           Yellow (05/27/2022)                 8.

     He barely moves. She opens the Amazon box and pulls out a
     TABLET HOLDER. It's a weird tray type thing that holds up a
     tablet so you can read in bed. She shows it to Mr. Linguini.

                         ANNE (CONT'D)
               Look! It's so you don't have to
               keep your arms up when you're
               reading while lying down!

     Anne looks at the product box -- there's a picture of a
     BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN SILK PAJAMAS looking incredible and cool
     as she lays in bed having so much fun reading.

                                                       CUT TO:

10                                                               10
     INT. ANNE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

     Anne lays on her couch, weirdly stiff, underneath the tablet
     holder, reading. It looks uncomfortable and not at all as
     much fun as the woman on the box was having.

     Mr. Linguini sleeps nearby, snoring louder than you ever
     thought possible. An ALARM goes off on Anne's phone. Anne
     jumps up, so excited. She turns on the TV, just in time for:

               It's seven o'clock on a weeknight,
               which can only mean one thing. It's
               time for Can't Stop the Quiz!

     ON SCREEN: A CGI BRAIN, who somehow looks a little ruder than
     previous versions, dances across the screen.

                         ANNE
               Linguini! It's on!

     Mr Linguini hobbles over, climbs up on the couch, and curls
     up next to her. Anne grabs a bag of Smartfood popcorn and
     happily settles in for her favorite show.

                         TERRY (ON TV)
               I'm your host, Terry McTeer. Let's
               meet today's contestants! Starting
               with our returning champion, Ron
               Heacock from Ohio.

     RON HEACOCK -- gleaming white teeth, oozing confidence --
     grins at the camera. This guy is a ham. Anne shakes her head.
     She HATES Ron Heacock.
                            Pink (05/25/2022)                    9.

                         TERRY (CONT'D)
               Ron, you must be getting pretty
               comfortable here. You're now the
               third longest running champion.
               Congratulations, that's quite an
               achievement.

                         RON HEACOCK
               Honestly I'm just glad to be here,
               Terry. I'm such a huge fan.

     He smiles, so charming. But Anne is disgusted.

                         ANNE
               Give me a break. Please let this be
               the day he finally loses.

     INT. ANNE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

     Anne glowers at the TV. Ron and ANOTHER CONTESTANT (Linda)
     are on stage with Terry. The audience is applauding.

                         TERRY
               Ron, your winning streak continues!

                         RON HEACOCK
               Linda! You did so great, I wish we
               could both win. How `bout it,
               Terry? Can there be two winners?

     Ron puts an arm around LINDA, an incredibly meek woman who
     really has no business being on television at all.

                         TERRY
               Unfortunately no. Ron, tonight
               you've won a very impressive sum of
               76,000 dollars!

     The audience cheers. Ron smiles and humbly waves it off.

                         RON HEACOCK
               Aw, thanks. But I just got lucky
               with those second-round bonuses.

                         TERRY
               Join us tomorrow for another night
               of fast facts and live learning!

     Terry does his salute. Ron, grinning big, does it too. Anne
     glowers at the TV, hating Ron.

     INT. ANNE'S CUBICLE - NEXT MORNING

     Anne inputs data into a spreadsheet. Trav and Marge are
     having a loud conversation right outside her cubicle.

                         TRAV
               No the computer makes the money!

                         MARGE
               I'm still confused. Start over.

     Anne's CELL PHONE RINGS. She sees it's from SUNNYVALE NURSING
     HOME. She hesitates, but finally answers.

                         ANNE
               Hi Mom.

                         SHANNON (O.S.)
               Hi! This is Shannon from Sunnyvale.

     Anne's face falls. This can't be good.

     INT. SUNNYVALE NURSING HOME - LOBBY - INTERCUT

     SHANNON (30s, a nurse with nervous energy) is on the phone.

                         SHANNON
               I'm calling with some bad news. We
               lost your mom.
                   (then, realizing)
               Oh my gosh sorry that's horrible
               phrasing, I meant we don't know
               where she is.

     Anne tries to process this emotional whiplash.

                         SHANNON (CONT'D)
               Sorry about that! Yeah, she's not
               dead. But she is missing.

                         ANNE
               Did you call Rivers Casino? Or
               Wheeling Island?
                           Yellow (05/27/2022)                11.

                         SHANNON
               We checked all her usual spots.
               That's actually what we wanted to
               discuss with you. Can you come in?

     Off Anne, worried what this is about...

14                                                             14
     INT. SUNNYVALE NURSING HOME - LOBBY - DAY

     A moderately nice nursing home. Anne enters through glass
     automatic sliding doors. Shannon and MR. WALTERS (50s, too
     serious) are at the front desk. In the BG: SOME SENIORS sit
     around a table, batting a balloon around.

                         MR. WALTERS
               Ms. Yum, thank you for coming in.

                         ANNE
               What is this about?

                         MR. WALTERS
               Would you like to wait for your
               sister? She'll be here momentarily.

                         ANNE
               My sister? You called Jenny?

                         SHANNON
               Well, when we lose someone, we kind
               of have to call everybody?

                         MR. WALTERS
               We didn't lose her. She ran away.

                         ANNE
               It's okay, she does this sometimes--

                         MR. WALTERS
               Ms. Yum, we've been very lenient
               with your mother, but enough is
               enough. Due to the sheer number of
               rule violations, we can no longer
               keep her as a resident.

     As they talk, we see, behind Anne, through a WALL OF GLASS
     DOORS AND WINDOWS, in DEEP BG, JENNY (now 40s, messy, a human
     tornado) running through the parking lot. She's wearing a
     TIGHT BLACK DRESS, which makes running difficult.
                                                         12.

                    ANNE
          Wait... you're kicking her out? Can
          you even do that?

Jenny -- running across the parking lot without looking -- is
lightly hit by a car pulling out of a parking spot. She
FREAKS OUT, like an NBA Player reacting to a bad call.

                    MR. WALTERS
          In signing the resident agreement,
          she agreed to adhere to our
          policies, and that failure to do so
          would result in eviction. It's
          clearly stated in section 4V--

Jenny is now WAILING, leaning on the car. The DRIVER gets
out, concerned and apologetic. Jenny animatedly screams at
him, kicks the car and keeps running towards us.

                    MR. WALTERS (CONT'D)
          Sneaking out is a very serious
          violation. We can't be liable for
          her safety.

Jenny gets to a SIDE DOOR, very close to the main door. But
this is a LOCKED GLASS DOOR. She pulls on it. It won't open.
She pulls harder. Nothing. She goes nuts trying to pull it.

                    SHANNON
          She's also really mean. That's less
          important but it's not nothing.

Mr. Walters notices Jenny outside.

                    MR. WALTERS
          I think your sister's here.

Anne turns -- Jenny sits, crying, by the locked door, having
just completely given up. Anne rolls her eyes, annoyed.

                    ANNE
          Jenny! Jenny!

She gets Jenny's attention through the glass door. Jenny sees
her and mouths: "Anne! How did you get in there??"

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
          Through the entrance.
                       Blue (05/18/2022)                 13.

Anne points to the automatic sliding doors, which are truly
SO close to the side door. Jenny looks at the doors, so
indignant. She mouths: "There should be a sign!"

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
          There IS a sign-- just, come in!

Jenny comes in. She unsuccessfully tries to pull it together.

                    JENNY
          Oh, Annie. Annie, Annie, Annie. It
          finally happened. But don't worry.
          I'm here.

Anne looks at her sexy black body-con dress.

                    ANNE
          What are you wearing?

                    JENNY
          It's the only black thing I own.
              (crying)
          I can't believe she's gone. We're
          orphans.

Jenny sobs and hugs Anne. Shannon winces. This is her fault.

                    ANNE
          She's not dead. She ran away.

Jenny looks at her for a moment, stunned, but then--

                    JENNY
          That fucking bitch.

AN ORDERLY walks up, with a suitcase and some boxes.

                    SHANNON
          We took the liberty of packing up
          your mother's belongings for you.

                    ANNE
              (sarcastic)
          Thanks. What a pleasant eviction.

                    SHANNON
              (genuine)
          Oh I'm so glad.

One of the orderlies hands Shannon a note. As she reads it --
                              Yellow (05/27/2022)             14.

                           JENNY
               Eviction?

                         SHANNON
               Good news! Looks like your mom left
               a note. It's mostly personal
               attacks on me, but she said she's
               off to Macao with Jeff. At least
               now we know where she went!

     Anne and Jenny stare at Shannon, so confused.

                         ANNE
               Who is Jeff?!

15                                                             15
     EXT. SUNNYVALE NURSING HOME - DAY

     Anne and Jenny walk out, saddled with Crystal's stuff. Jenny
     has a FRAMED PHOTO of Crystal and JEFF (70s). They're wearing
     matching Christmas sweaters. The car that hit Jenny in the
     previous scene is still there.

                         JENNY
               She has a boyfriend? Why didn't she
               tell us?

                         ANNE
               Because she only calls when she
               needs money.

     Anne unlocks her car.

                         JENNY
               Oh you're parked right by me!

     Jenny nods to her car, which is dirty and busted. It's filled
     with clothes and random shit.

                         ANNE
               Are you living out of your car?

                         JENNY
               No! It's just extra clothes in case
               I need to change. And some stuff
               I've been meaning to donate. And an
               amazing lamp I found in an alley.
               And some blankets and pillows in
               case I want to nap.

     Anne finishes loading Crystal's stuff and closes her trunk.
                            Yellow (05/27/2022)               15.

               Sorry you drove down for no reason.

                         JENNY
               Actually -- I thought maybe I
               could stay with you for a few days.

                           ANNE
               Why?

                         JENNY
               Well I thought I was going to,
               since Mom was dead. Come on, it'll
               be fun. And I want to see my dog.

                           ANNE
               Your dog?

                         JENNY

               remember?

                         ANNE
               You bought him from a van in a
               Smart and Final parking lot.

     INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - DAY

     Jenny and Anne walk in, carrying Crystal's stuff and Jenny's
     stuff. Jenny takes in the space.

                         JENNY
               What did you do to your house?

                         ANNE
               Nothing. It's the same as the last
               time you were here.

                         JENNY
               Ugh, that was the worst Christmas.
               Remember how Mom freaked out
               because you didn't have a tree?
               Since when did she even like those?
                                                                 16.

     Jenny looks around. She spots a PHOTO of 8 YEAR OLD ANNE
     sitting at the dining table of their Uncle's house, a ROCK
     COLLECTION spread out in front of her. She's uncomfortably,
     barely smiling for the camera. 18 YEAR OLD JENNY is in the
     background, laughing with a TEEN COUSIN.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
               It feels smaller. Are you sure you
               didn't make it smaller?

                         ANNE
               No, I didn't shrink my house.

     Jenny follows Anne further into the living room. Jenny sees
     Mr. Linguini, motionless on the floor. She SCREAMS.

                         JENNY
               Oh my god, he's dead!

                         ANNE
               He's sleeping.

                         JENNY
               Look at him! He's dead!

                         ANNE
               No he isn't. Mr. Linguini! Hey! Mr.
               Linguini!

     Mr. Linguini, who does look super dead, doesn't move. But
     after a beat, he lets out an INCREDIBLY LOUD SNORE.

                         ANNE (CONT'D)
               See? Full of life.

     Jenny still doesn't buy it.

     Anne fills up a kettle. We see Jenny in the living room,
     making herself at home. She hoists her suitcase onto the
     couch and opens it, stuff exploding everywhere.

                         ANNE
               So how long do you plan on staying?

                         JENNY
               I dunno. Few days?
                                                         17.

                    ANNE
          You don't have to get back for work
          or anything?

                    JENNY
          No, I don't have a job.

Anne waits, expecting more of an explanation. But Jenny
doesn't seem to think it warrants one. Jenny pulls SLIPPERS
out from the bottom of her suitcase and puts them on.

                    ANNE
          Are you... looking for a job?

                    JENNY
          No. I'm focusing all my energy on
          manifesting the life that I want. A
          job is just a detail. I'm big
          picture thinking.

                    ANNE
          But what are you going to do for
          money? I can't afford to loan you
          any more, Mom's nursing home wasn't
          exactly cheap--

                    JENNY
          I don't need money. I'm getting
          plenty from my lawsuit.

                    ANNE
          What lawsuit?

                    JENNY
          I didn't tell you? Basically I had
          a business lunch at Choochie's with
          a guy who wanted to invest in my
          fashion line, and I took a bite of
          my tilapia filet and there was a
          fishbone in it! It got stuck in my
          throat, and I almost choked to
          death, so I sued them, and they
          were like "please don't" and I was
          like "sorry, it's happening" and
          they were like "fine just take this
          money" and I was like "great!"

WHILE JENNY EXPLAINS, we see a QUICK FLASH:
                              Yellow (05/27/2022)             18.
18                                                             18
     INT. CHOOCHIE'S - DAY

     Jenny is choking. A SLEAZY BUSINESSMAN tries to give her the
     Heimlich but he's not 100% sure he's doing it right.

19                                                             19
     INT. KITCHEN - DAY

     Anne looks at Jenny, not charmed by this story.

                         ANNE
               You sued Choochie's because there
               was a fish bone in a fish filet.

                         JENNY
               Fish bones are famously sharp
               bones! I could've died! Why can't
               you just be happy that I got a
               bunch of money from them? Who are
               you, Mr. Choochie's?

                         ANNE
               Now why would I be Mr. Choochie's?

                         JENNY
               Cause it's a man's world!

     Anne rolls her eyes, so annoyed.

20                                                             20
     INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

     Anne sits on the couch, reading. Jenny is idly pulling a
     seemingly endless supply of hair extensions out of her hair.
     Anne eyes Jenny's discarded hair pile, annoyed.

                         ANNE
               Don't just leave them there.

                          JENNY
               Ok, Dad.

     Jenny looks around at Anne's apartment.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
               Have you ever considered painting
               the walls? I follow Mandy Moore's
               best friend's interior designer and
               they say Bixton Blue makes a room
               bigger.
                       Pink (05/25/2022)                 19.

Anne doesn't even respond. Her ALARM goes off. It's a version
of the Quiz theme song.

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          What's that?

                    ANNE
          Nothing, it's...

Anne doesn't really want to admit what it is. She turns on
the TV. Terry is on screen, wearing a different bow tie.

                    JENNY
          Oh my god, you have a Quiz alarm?

                    ANNE
          Come on, Mr. Linguini!

Mr. Linguini comes over and curls up next to her.

                    TERRY (ON TV)
          Let's meet today's contestants.
          Starting with our returning
          champion, Ron Heacock from --
              (cough)
          -- excuse me! From Ohio.

                    RON HEACOCK
          You okay Terry?

                    TERRY
          Yes. I just ate some crackers
          backstage, must've gotten some
          crumbs down the wrong pipe. That's
          live television for you.

                    RON HEACOCK
          Good. I worry about you, Ter. You
          work too hard. You should loosen up
          that bowtie sometime. Take a
          vacation.

                    JENNY
          Aww.

                    ANNE
          Don't aww him. He's a jerk.

                    JENNY
          But he seems so nice!
                        Pink (05/25/2022)                  20.

                    ANNE
          He's not. It's an act.

                    JENNY
          How can you tell?

                      ANNE
          It's just   so forced. It's like he's
          trying to   be Terry. Everything
          about him   is fake. Look at the
          smears on   his buzzer, he wears make-
          up on his   hands!

                    JENNY
              (shrugs)
          Some people have ugly hands.

Anne ignores that, focuses on the TV.

                    TERRY (ON TV)
          And your time. Starts. Now! What is
          the square root of 196?

                      ANNE
          14.

She answers it just as Ron Heacock chimes in on screen.

                      RON HEACOCK (ON TV)
          14.

                    TERRY (ON TV)
          Correct! What is the southernmost
          capital of the world?

                    ANNE
          Wellington, New Zealand.

Jenny watches as Anne gets every question immediately:

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
          Saffron. Three. The equal sign.
          Carbon dioxide. Our American
          Cousin. Saturn. The Hobbit.

The montage of Anne rapid-fire answering builds until she's
listing Gods of Mount Olympus for the Head to Head --
                                                         21.

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
          Zeus, Poseidon, Hera, Athena,
          Aphrodite, Hermes, Apollo,
          Dionysus, Ares, Artemis--

Jenny, so impressed, excitedly kicks Anne.

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
          OW!

                    JENNY
          Why haven't you gone on the show?!

Anne shushes her, still watching the show.

                    ANNE
              (annoyed, retracing)
          Zeus, Poseidon, Hera --

                    JENNY
          Are you scared you'd win so much
          money that people would try to kill
          you for it? You know that's a thing
          with lottery winners.

                    ANNE
          No, it's not --

                    JENNY
          Are you scared that your hatred of
          that Ron guy is actually an intense
          sexual attraction and you wouldn't
          know how to navigate it in person?

                    ANNE
          No! I just -- I'm not good at...
          being looked at.

Jenny looks confused by that. Anne brushes off the rare
moment of vulnerability, focuses on the game: Ron, Terry, and
A CONTESTANT stand by a COIN THE SIZE OF A DINNER TABLE.

                    TERRY
          It's time for the flip!

                    ANNE
          Ugh, the stupid coin.

                    JENNY
          I love the coin! It's so big!
                           Yellow (05/27/2022)                22.

     The coin spins and then lands on --

                         TERRY
               Show It! Our contestants will act
               out the answers while their
               partners guess.

     Anne turns off the TV.

                         JENNY
               What are you doing? The charades
               thing is the only fun part!

                         ANNE
               It's not fun, it's a cheap gimmick.
               They changed the entire final round
               to try to boost the ratings. Which
               is so dumb. Who wants to watch
               people embarrass themselves?

     Anne goes to the kitchen. Once she's gone --

                         JENNY
               I do.

     Jenny turns the TV on. Ron is mid-Show It!, waltzing around
     the stage. The clue is onscreen: WALTER KRONKITE. BART, Ron's
     partner, who has dead eyes, is methodically guessing.

                         BART
               Waltz. Waltzer. Sidewalk. Concrete.
               Waltzer. Concrete. Walter Kronkite.

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING

     Jenny, passed out on the couch. Hair extensions still in a
     pile where she left them. She still has a City Beauty sheet
     mask on. She finds a note from Anne: "Went to work. Be home
     around 5. Pick up your hair!!!"

22                                                             22
     INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

     Jenny shuffles in, peeling off the sheet mask. She opens a
     cabinet -- it's pretty bare, just two plates, two bowls, two
     glasses, etc., all meticulously in place.

                         JENNY
               It's like a robot's house.
                               Pink (05/25/2022)              23.

     She opens another cabinet, there's just a few boxes of tea.
     She opens another, it's FILLED with Smartfood bags.

     Jenny notices...

     A TERRY MCTEER BOBBLEHEAD. Jenny picks it up to take a closer
     look, then puts it down, not in its place, and walks out,
     leaving all the cabinet doors open.

23                                                             23
     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     Jenny sits, drinking an iced latte, a plate with crumbs on it
     in front of her. She's mid-conversation with WENDY.

                         JENNY
               And I realized I'm tired of chasing
               my destiny. Because I've always
               known what I want. I want to be
               rich and famous and loved by
               everybody, so I can be a really
               powerful force for good in this
               world. But I just haven't found the
               path to get there yet. And I've
               tried so many paths.

     Jenny shakes her head, so tired from all the paths.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
               It's hard to stay optimistic, you
               know? And you start to wonder,
               maybe it's me. But then you have to
               remind yourself: sometimes things
               don't work out for reasons that are
               completely out of your control.
               It's bad timing or bad luck or
               gatekeeping. I mean do you have any
               idea how hard it is to be an Asian
               woman in this country?

     Wendy, who is white, nods. She's been listening and learning.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
               You're right. I can't let that
               stuff drag me down. Because we
               can't spend all our energy just
               wishing the obstacles weren't
               there, you know? We have to keep
               going!
                              Pink (05/25/2022)               24.

                         WENDY
               But how do you know what's an
               obstacle and what's a dead end?
               Like I've always wanted to open my
               own bakery, you know. But it's so
               hard, so I put it off, then life
               got in the way and now I never bake
               anymore and I feel so unfulfilled.
               But what am I supposed to do?

                         JENNY
               You need to change your life.

                            WENDY
               I can't.

                         JENNY
               Yes you can. You're strong.

     Wendy nods, letting that sink in. After a beat...

                         WENDY
               So are you done with your plate?

                            JENNY
               Yeah.

     Wendy takes Jenny's plate and goes back behind the counter.
     Her CONFUSED MANAGER is annoyed with her for taking so long,
     they get in a little tiff in the background as:

     Jenny takes a sip of her iced latte, looking happy and proud
     about the exchange with Wendy. Then suddenly, SHE GASPS.

                            JENNY (CONT'D)
               OH MY GOD!

     Everyone looks at her. She grabs her stuff and rushes out.

24                                                                24
     EXT. ANNE'S HOUSE - LATER

     Anne pulls into her driveway. Jenny sits on the stoop. As
     Anne gets out of the car, Jenny, super excited, jumps up.
                            Blue (05/18/2022)                  25.

                         JENNY
               Hi! I had a huge day.

                         ANNE
               Why are you sitting out here?

                         JENNY
               I locked myself out.

     Francine peaks out from her door.

                         FRANCINE
               Anne! This lunatic is your sister?

                          JENNY
               I told you!
                   (to Anne)
               She threatened to call the cops
               because she thought I was

                         FRANCINE
               You were loitering. I thought you
               were loitering with an intent to
               murder.

                         JENNY
               Sorry about me? What did I do?!

     Anne ushers Jenny into her house. Francine scowls at them.

     INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Anne and Jenny walk in. Jenny follows Anne, on a tear:

                         JENNY
               Okay, so! I went to get a coffee
               and I met this woman who was so
               sad. But then we got to talking,
               and I helped her!
                                                         26.

Anne notices all the cabinets in the kitchen are ajar. She
sighs, annoyed, and goes to close them. Jenny follows her,
not even noticing that Anne is cleaning up her mess:

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          And helping her made me feel
          better. And just like that, I saw
          it. I saw the path forward.

Anne sees the misplaced Terry Bobblehead.

                    ANNE
          Don't move my stuff!

                      JENNY
          I didn't!

                    ANNE
          This is limited edition! It's from
          the 300th episode, I endured a very
          heated Ebay war to get this!

                    JENNY
          Really? What's it worth?

Anne rolls her eyes. Jenny doesn't get it.

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          So as I was saying... I decided I'm
          going to become a life coach.

Anne almost laughs. She goes to get Mr. Linguini's leash.

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          You know, like Oprah.

Now Anne does laugh. Jenny glares at her.

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          Don't laugh. This is my destiny.

                    ANNE
          Oh my god, you and your destinies.
          First it was figure skating, then
          acting, then "being a music icon",

                         ANNE
               How?

                         JENNY
               I'll show you. Because you're gonna
               be my first project.

                         ANNE
               I don't need a life coach.

                         JENNY
               Really? Because from what I can
               tell, you're a twenty-eight-year-
               old woman living the life of a
               ninety-eight-year-old widower.

                         ANNE
               I'm thirty-three. And why am I
               always a man in your hypotheticals?

                         JENNY
               Because men are worse.

                         ANNE
               Well I'm not interested. My life is
               just fine how it is.

     Anne leaves with Mr. Linguini. Jenny watches her go, not
     buying that at all.

26                                                                26
     INT. ANNE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Anne and Mr. Linguini are cuddled up on the couch, watching
     the Quiz. Jenny lies on her back on the ground, with a
     weighted eye mask on. Anne eyes her, annoyed.

                         ANNE
               What are you doing?

                         JENNY
               Yoga.

     Anne focuses on the TV just as THE HEAD TO HEAD STARTS. Anne
     doesn't notice as Jenny starts filming the TV, then pans over
     to film Anne listing South American Capital Cities:

     INT. LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING

     Jenny is asleep on the couch, another sheet mask dried on her
     face. Her phone DINGS with tons of alerts. Anne comes back
     from Mr. Linguini's morning walk. She hangs up his leash.

     Jenny sleepily waves her off. Anne leaves. After a beat of
     more DINGS on Jenny's phone, there's a POUNDING ON THE WALL.

               floats through life without ever

               the Heinz ketchup museum and she

     He walks off. It takes Anne a second to register --

                          ANNE
               My dog?

     Ken goes to a LUXURY SUV. A TERRIFYING ASIAN GUY waits by the
     car. An EQUALLY TERRIFYING ASIAN GUY is in the driver's seat.

                         KEN
               I'll give you two weeks. After
               that, you'll never see him again.

     Off Anne, horrified...

     EXT. ANNE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

     Jenny, holding an iced coffee and talking on the phone, walks
     down the street towards Anne's house.

                   (on phone)
               Amazing! We'll be there.

     Anne's car comes FLYING by and careens into the driveway.
     Anne gets out of the car, and stops dead in her tracks when
     she sees: THE FRONT DOOR IS OPEN.

                         ANNE
               No. Linguini!

     She runs for her house. Jenny runs after her.

                         JENNY
               Annie? What's going on?!

     INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

     Anne sits on the couch, devastated. So lonely without Mr.
     Linguini. Jenny looks at Ken's business card.

                         JENNY
               Who's even named Ken anymore?

                         ANNE
               This is all your fault. He found me
               because of your stupid video.

                         JENNY
               Come on, he would've found you
               eventually. If I remember several
               ruined dinners from our childhood
               correctly, bookies are very good at
               tracking people down.

     INT. ANNE AND JENNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1996

     6-YEAR-OLD ANNE and 16-YEAR-OLD JENNY are at the dinner
     table. They watch, wide-eyed as TWO SCARY ASIAN GANGSTERS
     walk out with an entire Thanksgiving dinner. We can hear
     CRYSTAL and THEIR DAD arguing off-screen.

     Jenny takes out her phone and dials.

                    ANNE
          What are you doing? Are you calling
          him??

                    JENNY
          I'm calling mom.

                    ANNE
          That's not going to do anything.

                    CRYSTAL (O.S.)
          Hello?

                    JENNY
          You left us with an eighty thousand
          dollar debt!

                    CRYSTAL (O.S.)
          It's okay, I'm in Macao.

We can hear the SOUNDS OF A CASINO in Crystal's background.

                    JENNY
          Of course you're at a casino.

                    CRYSTAL (O.S.)
          It's okay. Just penny slots.

                    JENNY
          It's not okay! None of this is
          okay! Your bookie threatened Annie
          and kidnapped my dog!

                    ANNE
          He's not your dog!

          Oh, no. How did they find you? I
          never talk about my daughters.

          Thanks Mom.

                    CRYSTAL (O.S.)
          You don't want to mess with these
          people, Jenny. They're bad news.

                    JENNY
          Well what are we supposed to do?!
                       Blue (05/18/2022)                 36.

                    CRYSTAL (O.S.)
              (thinks, then)
          You girls can come to Macao. Jeff
          bought a condo. It's only one
          bedroom but the closet is big.

                    JENNY
          We don't want to live in your
          fucking condo!

                    CRYSTAL (O.S.)
          Don't swear! Aiya, who raised you?

                    JENNY
          NOBODY!

Jenny hurls her phone at the wall. It knocks over a vase,
which shatters. Jenny makes no effort to clean it up.

                    ANNE
          I told you.

They sit in a heavy silence for a beat, reality sinking in.

                    JENNY
          OH MY GOD!!!

Anne jumps, terrified, looks to the window--

                    ANNE
          WHAT?! Are they here?!

                    JENNY
          This is all connected. It's
          synergy, from the universe. I
          manifested this!

                    ANNE
          I hate all the words you just used.

                    JENNY
          This debt will not deter us. It
          will spur us. I know how we'll get
          the money. Someone from the Quiz
          reached out. They saw your video.

                    ANNE
          What?! No! That's so embarrassing!!

               They loved it! They're in the
               middle of a casting round, and they
               want you to come to the in-person
               Regional audition this weekend in
               Philadelphia!

                         ANNE
               No. That's not happening.

                         JENNY
               But you could win 80 grand like
               that! You got every question right!

                         ANNE
               Yeah because I was at home, with
               Linguini, on my couch! I can't play
               on live TV, in front of millions of
               people and Terry freakin' McTeer
               himself! I can't do it. There has
               to be another way.

     Anne looks off, racking her brain.

                         JENNY
               You could sell your eggs. It's not
               like you're using `em.

                         ANNE
               I'm not selling my eggs.

     Jenny looks at Anne, feeling bad.

                         JENNY
               Well I am not going to let Mom's
               fuck up ruin your life. I will get
               us out of this.

     Anne is too drained to argue. She walks out.

     Anne comes out from her bedroom.

               Okay I went on Carmax, and it looks
               like I can easily sell my car for

     She sees the couch is empty. Before she can react, there's a
     POUNDING ON THE FRONT DOOR. Anne nervously goes over and
     checks the peephole, then opens it to reveal FRANCINE.

                         FRANCINE
               I need your help. The paper boy
               missed the porch. I think he's been
               vaping drugs again.

     Francine nods to a newspaper in the driveway, by Anne's car.

                         FRANCINE (CONT'D)
               I would get it myself but bending
               over that far is too dangerous for
               an almost-ghost like me.

     EXT. ANNE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     Anne heads for the newspaper by her car. Francine follows.

                         FRANCINE
               Oh, and could I borrow your phone?
               I want to check my stocks.

     Anne, confused, hands her phone to Francine.

                         ANNE
               Is everything okay? You seem weird.

     We see Jenny is nearby, crouched in the bushes, hiding. She
     holds up car keys and hits a button.

                           FRANCINE
               I'm fine.

     Anne hands the newspaper to Francine. Behind Anne, the trunk
     of Anne's car pops open. Anne turns -- what the?

                         JENNY
               DON'T BE SCARED IT'S ME!!!!!!

     Jenny charges. Francine steps out of the way as Jenny shoves
     Anne into the trunk of the car. She slams the trunk closed.

                         ANNE (O.S.)
               What are you doing?!

     Francine holds Anne's phone out. Jenny takes it.

                         FRANCINE
               Where's my hundred bucks?

                         JENNY
               I don't have any cash on me. Sorry!

               How could you do this when I was
               JUST threatened by a GENUINE TONG?!

                         JENNY
               That's why I yelled "don't be
               scared it's me!"

                         FRANCINE
               What's a tong?

                         JENNY
               Asian gangsters. Read a book. And
               don't worry, I'm fixing it. They
               won't interfere with your busy
               schedule of being a shut-in.

                         FRANCINE
               It already has!

     Jenny gets into the car and drives off, Anne pounding on the
     trunk of the car. Francine watches them go, annoyed.

                         JENNY
               Don't be so dramatic. I put a bunch
               of snacks and pillows in there. Sit
               back, relax, and enjoy the ride!

     Jenny cranks the volume on the stereo, playing Lit's My Own
     Worst Enemy. She rocks out for an intentionally kinda long
     time:
                        Blue (05/18/2022)                40.

          Please tell me why my car is in the
          front yard and I'm sleeping with my
          clothes on
          I came in through the window last
          night - ah-ooooh!
          It's no surprise to me I am my own
          worst enemy - Ah-ooooh! - 'Cause
          every now and then I kick the
          living shit out of me, ah-ooo--

BOOM! Part of the backseat rockets forward and Anne clamors
through the small opening. A FLOOD OF SNACKS erupts with her.

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!

                    ANNE

                      JENNY
          NEVER!!!!

Anne, stuck between the trunk and the backseat, wildly swipes
at Jenny's arm. Jenny swats back at Anne. As they fight,
music still blasting, the car veers wildly.

                    ANNE
          THIS IS DANGEROUS! PULL OVER!

                    JENNY
          GET BACK IN THE TRUNK!

Anne's eyes go wide -- there's a car coming RIGHT AT THEM!
They're in the wrong lane!

                      ANNE
          JENNY!

At the last second, Jenny jerks the wheel hard. They SCREAM
as the car skids across the small two-lane highway, careening
towards a ditch! The car stops JUST short rolling into it!

Anne and Jenny sit in stunned silence, adrenaline pumping.

A LARGE PICK-UP TRUCK DRIVES PAST.

                    PICK-UP TRUCK DRIVER (O.S.)
          Learn how to drive!

Jenny yells out the window:

                         JENNY
               RACIST!

     The driver glares at her. Jenny sees it's an ASIAN MAN and
     her face immediately brightens into a big smile.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
               Oh hi!

     As the pick-up drives off, Anne gets out of the car.

     Jenny gets out of the car. Anne holds her shoe like a weapon.

               Give me my phone.

               Then I'm taking the car!

     Anne bolts for the car, Jenny grabs her. They clumsily
     grapple, eventually falling over. They roll down a slight
     incline and land in a GRASSY DITCH.

                         JENNY
               You are going to Philadelphia!

                         JENNY
               Look, the Quiz is the best and
               fastest option to get the money. So
               unless you want to sell your eggs,
               we need to get to Philadelphia.

     Anne can't believe this. Jenny's right.

                         ANNE
               Fine. But I'm driving.

     They get in the car and drive off.

     A STOCK FOOTAGE MONTAGE of Philadelphia landmarks - the
     skyline, Rocky steps, Liberty Bell, maybe the big balloon at
     the zoo, etc. Suddenly, a LARGE THUMB appears in frame.

               Wow. I always forget how beautiful
               this city is.

          They should. They have a lot of
          really interesting history here.

                    JENNY
          Ooh yeah, if we have time we should
          take the National Treasure tour.

Anne's phone DINGS. Jenny checks it. Her face darkens.

                    ANNE
          What? What is it?

Jenny shows her: it's a PHOTO OF MR. LINGUINI in a LUXURIOUS
DOG BED. A LARGE TATTOOED FOUR-FINGERED HAND on his neck. The
photo is threatening but also... vaguely sexual???

                    JENNY
          What is he gonna do to our dog?

                    ANNE
          I don't know! He's not gonna hurt
          him, is he? He can't --

                    JENNY
          He won't. It's okay. Let's just get
          to the hotel.

                    ANNE
          Yeah. Okay. What's the address?

                    JENNY
          I don't know. I'm still looking for
          one.

Jenny holds up her phone - we see the Philadelphia monuments
montage video is on a janky website WHERETOSLEEP2NITE.COM

                    ANNE
          You didn't book one before we left?

     Jenny and Anne enter. A BEN FRANKLIN IMPERSONATOR (a nervous
     man who just wants to do his best, has adult braces that he's
     REALLY insecure about) is at the front desk.

                         BEN FRANKLIN
               Good morrow, ladies! Welcome to the
               Ben Franklin Inn & Spa. May I
               interest you in a corn pancake?

     He gestures to a basket of complimentary corn pancakes.

               No. Where's the spa?

                         BEN FRANKLIN
               There is a special tub with hot,
               bubbly water in the John Hancock
               Suite.

               Jacuzzi! What a fun word. I only
               know it as a special tub.

               Ah yes! You just rang on the
               telephone, a marvelous machine that
               I am unfamiliar with. May I please
               have some identification and a
               credit card?

               you know about credit cards?

                         BEN FRANKLIN
               The concept of a credit card is an
               easy one to grasp.

          I know what credit is, and I can
          assure you, I am familiar with
          cards. But the telephone is
          something that was not invented in
          my time.

Anne reaches for her wallet. The HOTEL PHONE rings.

                    BEN FRANKLIN (CONT'D)
              (for their benefit)

                    JENNY
          So -- are you supposed to be Ben
          Franklin? Because if Ben Franklin
          had just been alive this whole
          time, he would know what phones
          are. I mean, he was really smart.

Ben Franklin laughs uncomfortably.
                                                           45.

                    BEN FRANKLIN
          Yes, well... um, thank you for
          saying that I am smart.

                    JENNY
          But if you don't know about phones,
          then, what, you're just like a
          ghost of Ben Franklin who's somehow
          stuck in the 1600s?

          1700s.

                    JENNY
          So if you're in the past, then your
          inn shouldn't have modern stuff. It
          makes no sense. So which is it?
          What are you?

Ben Franklin blinks, unsure how to continue.

                    BEN FRANKLIN
          I am Ben Franklin.

          They never even talked about Dad.
          It was like they wanted to forget

     Jenny solemnly puts the phone down. Anne looks so sad.

                         ANNE
               He's going to make it so Linguini
               doesn't even want to leave.

                         JENNY
               Wow. That's fucked up. It's...
               almost brilliant. In a bad way.

     Anne shoots her a look -- really? Jenny feels bad.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
               Hey, it's okay. We're going to get
               him back. I promise.

     Anne nods uneasily, not really buying it.

                         ANNE
               Do you have a laptop or something?
               I can't sleep without noise.

                         JENNY
               Yeah, in that bag.
                                                         57.

Anne goes to one of Jenny's bags and rifles through it,
pulling out SO much shit -- a pocket umbrella, a small plate,
some canned drinks. She finally finds a LARGE, BULKY LAPTOP.

                    ANNE
          When did you buy this? 1970?

                    JENNY
          Chad gave it to me. And he was in
          the CIA so you know it's powerful.

Jenny takes out some KAHI Bounce Balm and applies it all over
her face as she talks.

                    ANNE
          Who's Chad?

                    JENNY
          You know Chad. The guy after Lars.

                    ANNE
          Was Lars the one with the boxed
          soda company?

                    JENNY
          No that was Michael. Lars was the
          glaciologist. Aren't you supposed
          to have a good memory?

                    ANNE
          Sorry there's just so many.

Jenny eyes Anne, sensing the judgment in her tone.

                    JENNY
          Well I remember everyone you've
          ever dated. Since it was just that
          one weird kid who was so pale he
          was basically see-through.

                    ANNE
          Francoise was not see-through.

                    JENNY
          It was like someone saran-wrapped a
          skeleton.
              (then, offering)
          Bounce Balm?

                    ANNE
          No, I'm good.
                                                         58.

                    JENNY
          Are you sure? It's Korean.

                    ANNE
          I didn't even date Francoise, we
          were just friends. And it's not his
          fault he's allergic to the sun.

Anne starts to build a pillow wall in the middle of the bed.

                    JENNY
          What are you doing?

                    ANNE
          I want my own space.

Jenny gets in bed, moves the pillows.

                    JENNY
          But I sleep with two pillows.

Anne grabs the pillows.

                    ANNE
          You can have two pillows if you
          sleep on the floor.

                     JENNY
          I'm wounded! I'm not sleeping on
          the floor.

                    ANNE
          Well I'm not either!

                    JENNY
          Then-- sleep on the chair!

She points to a DEEPLY UNCOMFORTABLE WOODEN CHAIR.

                    ANNE
          No!

                    JENNY
          What is the big deal? We used to
          sleep together all the time.

                    ANNE
          Twenty years ago. Before you left.

                          JENNY
                Fine. Pillow wall.

                          ANNE
                And head to foot.

      Jenny rolls her eyes. Whatever. They get in bed, head to
      foot, a wall of pillows separating them.

                          JENNY
                I know you're nervous about
                tomorrow, but... is there at least
                a small part of you that's excited?

                          ANNE
                Maybe. A small part.

                          JENNY
                You're gonna be great.

      Anne allows herself to kinda believe that. She turns over to
      the computer and puts on an old episode of CSQ.

62A   INT. BEN FRANKLIN INN & SPA - ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 62A

      Anne wakes up in the middle of the night. She has a startled
      moment of not knowing where she is. She looks over, sees
      Jenny. Calms down a little. She turns around, so she's lying
      the right way instead of upside down. She settles into bed.

      The next morning. Anne and Jenny are now sleeping face to
      face, it looks like two sisters sweetly sharing a bed. Jenny
      wakes up, sees Anne. She smiles.

      REVEAL Jenny has all the blankets, Anne is shivering. Jenny
      brushes hair out of Anne's face and gently shakes her awake.

               Yeah.

               I can't do this.

                         JENNY
               Yes you can! You know why?

     Jenny takes her by the shoulders and looks at her with the
     same conviction she showed Wendy in the coffee shop.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
               You're strong.

     clipboard. She and Jenny go sit.

               Don't think about them. Focus on

               Because I wanted some! But oh well.
               Come on, let's go.

     Jenny, nervous but trying to hide it, leads Anne off.

     Jenny walks Anne in.

                         JENNY
               How do you feel?

                         ANNE
               The same. When is that thing
               supposed to kick iiiiiiiiiiiin.

     IN SLOW MOTION: A goofy grin lights up Anne's face.
                            Blue (05/18/2022)                 65.

     ANNE'S DRUGGED OUT POV: The room is brighter, more welcoming.
     A soft Enya-like rendition of the CSQ Theme plays. Anne sees
     the Terry cardboard cut-out and happily waves. The cut-out
     winks at her.

     As Jenny leads Anne to her seat, Anne looks at the carpet,
     which TURNS INTO SOFT GRASS. She looks up, sees the CEILING
     LIGHTS turn into ADORABLE, SMILING CARTOON CLOUDS.

     IN REALITY:

     Anne is slumped in a chair, all muscles totally relaxed, open-
     mouthed grinning. Jenny tries to close her mouth, but it
     keeps flopping open to the same super stoned grin.

                         JENNY
               Close your mouth. You look insane.

     Mercedes walks to the front of the room to address everyone.

                         MERCEDES
               Good morning! For today's audition,

     Anne, relaxed on a toadstool. PUG PUPPIES in BOW TIES frolic
     around her. Jenny's hand grabs her. Anne turns --

     IN ANNE'S POV, she sees THE SUN, but it's Jenny's smiling
     face. And Jenny's hand on her shoulder is like a sunbeam.

                         SUN-JENNY
               It's your turn to play.

     Sun-Jenny nods to a GLITTERING QUIZ SET. It looks like Oz.
     The OLD VERSION OF THE BRAIN waves at her.
                                                                 66.

     Anne takes her place at the podium, petting her sweater.

                         ANNE
               This is so soft.

     She turns to CHARLES VON KAMPF next to her. He's an old,
     slender man who looks like a vampire.

                         ANNE (CONT'D)
               Look at you, Father Time. Feel how
               soft this is.

     She offers her arm to him. He recoils.

                         MERCEDES
               Alright. Five minutes on the clock.
               And your time. Starts. Now!

     As Mercedes goes through questions, Angela and Charles buzz
     in to answer. But Anne is spaced out, mindlessly rubbing her
     shirt (which looks like she's just rubbing her boobs)

     Jenny watches from the audience, panicked.

                         JENNY
               Shit shit shit.

     She opens up her purse and fishes out the bag of loose pills.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
               Come on, come on...

     Jenny holds up a LITTLE ORANGE PILL.

     Anne, totally blissed out, is trying to take off her fuzzy
     sweater while happily watching Charles Von Kampf answer --

               That's right. Good job to you.

                         MERCEDES
               Is everything alright, Ms. Yum?
                                                              67.

                         ANNE
               Yeah, I'm just warm.

     Anne goes to pull off her sweater, which pulls up her shirt
     and exposes her bra. Jenny hurries in, pulls the shirt down.

                         JENNY
               Sorry! My fault! I forgot to give
               her her diabetes medicine. She gets
               sleepy without it.

     Jenny holds the pill out to Anne, who's eyes are barely open.

                         CHARLES VON KAMPF
               Drowsiness can't be solved by a
               diabetes medication.

               Are you a doctor?!

                         CHARLES VON KAMPF
               Yes.

     Jenny puts the pill in Anne's mouth.

               Now swallow... great! Sorry for the

               named after a traitor. Alas it is a
               popular item that many expect from

          Too bad the Choochie's money isn't
          real, otherwise you could just fly
          around, helping people like Mary

          gonna get a giant check, just like

     eggs. She's grimacing. Her phone RINGS. She answers.

                         ANNE
               Internal auditing.

                         MERCEDES (O.S.)
               Hi! Is this Anne Yum?
                         Blue (05/18/2022)               81.

                       ANNE
          Yes...

                    MERCEDES (O.S.)
          This is Mercedes from the Quiz.
          Great news! We'd love to have you
          on the show! Any chance you could
          fly out tonight?

                       ANNE
          Tonight?!

Anne freezes. She looks at the egg selling website.

                       ANNE (CONT'D)
          Um... I...

                    MERCEDES (O.S.)
          I know it's last minute but we'd
          really love to capitalize on the
          buzz from your video--

Trav and Marge come into her cubicle, holding take-out sushi.
They sit and start eating, no idea Anne is there.

                     TRAV
          I'm telling you, you're gonna be
          regretting that extra spicy --
               (notices Anne)
          AHH!

Anne tries to shush them, straining to listen to Mercedes.

                    MERCEDES (O.S.)
          And we need the information for
          whoever you want to bring as your
          partner for the Coin Round...

                    MARGE
          Sorry, Fran. We thought you were
          still on vacation.

                    ANNE
          Were you eating lunch in here while
          I was gone?

                    TRAV
          Yeah, it's great. `Cause then the
          smell stays in a place where we
          aren't working.
                               Blue (05/18/2022)              82.

     They go back to talking and eating as if Anne isn't there.

                         MERCEDES (O.S.)
               Ms. Yum? Are you still there? We
               need to book the tickets ASAP.

     Anne glares at her coworkers, rage building, until:

                         ANNE
               HEY! I am SICK of being treated
               like some silent, invisible man! I
               EXIST! And you might not see me
               here, but tomorrow night you're
               gonna see me on TV!
                   (into phone)
               Book the ticket!

     She storms out. BADASS MUSIC KICKS IN AS WE GO TO:

     INT. ANNE'S HOUSE - QUICK PACKING MONTAGE

     Anne packs a suitcase. We see her pack a smart business
     casual outfit, her own pillow, and a photo of Mr. Linguini.

87                                                                87
     INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

     Jenny sits at the same coffee shop as before. She looks sad
     and lonely. She hears LAUGHTER. She looks over and sees:

     A MOM and TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS. The big sister has a well-
     loved stuffed bunny and is making it dance around for the
     little sister, who's loving it. It's so sweet.

     WENDY comes over, carrying a muffin on a plate.

                           WENDY
               Hi!

                           JENNY
               Danielle!

                         WENDY
               Wendy. I wanted to give you this,
               as a thank you.

                           JENNY
               For what?
                              Pink (05/25/2022)               83.

                         WENDY
               For inspiring me. You were right -
               I was so focused on all the things
               I couldn't do that I just quit. But
               I can't let that stuff drag me
               down. I just gotta bake. So I
               convinced my boss to let me take
               over the pastries. You changed my
               life, Janet.

                            JENNY
               Jenny.

     Wendy walks off. Jenny kind of smiles to herself. She looks
     back at the mom and daughters. The big sister makes the bunny
     hug the little sister. The little sister hugs it back.

     Jenny watches the moment, so touched. And then --

                            JENNY (CONT'D)
               OH MY GOD!

     Everyone looks at her, thrown by the outburst. After a beat,
     Jenny bolts out the door, passing the sisters, who are now in
     a knock-down drag-out fight for the bunny.

88                                                             88
     EXT. ANNE AND FRANCINE'S DUPLEX - DAY

     Anne pounds on Francine's door. Francine opens it, annoyed.

                         ANNE
               I need you to come with me to
               California.

                            FRANCINE
               No.

                         ANNE
               I have to bring a partner, in case
               the Coin lands on Show It. And I...
               I don't have anyone else.

                         FRANCINE
               What the hell is Show It?

     Off Anne, excited to tell her that it's basically charades...
                               Pink (05/25/2022)              83A.

     INT. JENNY'S CAR - DAY

     Jenny is parked. She steels herself. Closes her eyes.

                         JENNY
               I am strong.

     She takes a deep breath, and gets out of the car.
                            Pink (05/25/2022)                   84.

     EXT. STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

     Jenny marches towards a storefront called CHOSEN FAMILY
     CANINE RESCUE.

91                                                               91
     INT. CHOSEN FAMILY CANINE RESCUE - DAY

     Jenny walks into a janky pet store. There are no customers. A
     TOUGH GUY is at the counter. He looks over at her.

                         JENNY
               I'm here to see Ken.

92                                                               92
     INT. CHOSEN FAMILY CANINE RESCUE - BACK ROOM - DAY

     The tough guy shows Jenny to the surprisingly opulent BACK
     ROOM, which we recognize as Ken's Den. A bunch of guys hang
     out with dogs. Ken and Mr. Linguini wear matching shirts.

                         KEN
               Who the hell is this?

                         JENNY
               Crystal's other daughter.

                         KEN
               How'd you find me?

                         JENNY
               My ex-boyfriend is CIA.

                         KEN
               Coming here was a big mistake.

                         JENNY
               So was messing with my sister.
               Because now you're messing with me.
               You want the money? I'll get you
               the money. But first you're gonna
               give me back that dog.

                         KEN
               Actually I'm gonna break your legs.
                       Pink (05/25/2022)                  85.

His guys go to grab her, she immediately goes hysterical --

                    JENNY
          No wait!!! I'll give you double!! I
          swear! I'm about to get a VERY
          large cash settlement from
          Choochie's! Yeah, the nationwide
          chain Choochie's!! You've seen
          their commercials, they're rich! If
          you give me that dog back right
          now, I'll pay double! In seven to
          ten business days, maybe a little
          longer, apparently Monday is a
          holiday in some religion but I
          don't know which one!!!

She's crying. Ken laughs.

                    KEN
          You are just like your mom. She
          used to do the same crazy, crying,
          screaming shit. I'm done falling
          for that.

Jenny looks up at Ken, no longer hysterical. Resolved.

                    JENNY
          I am not my mom. Because I'm
          actually here. That dog has been by
          my sister's side for over twenty
          years.

                    KEN
          What? How old is he?

                    JENNY
          OLD. Annie has kept him alive for a
          miraculously long time. Because
          even though she's a painfully
          awkward, annoying little know-it-
          all, she takes care of the people
          around her. And Mr. Linguini is the
          only one in her life that has never
          let her down. She needs him. Just
          like you need my money.
              (off Ken's look)
          Yeah. I did my research. I know
          you're three months behind on rent.
          Must be hard to launder cash when
          you don't have any.
                            Pink (05/25/2022)                 86.

     Ken eyes his guys, nervous. The guys look confused.

                         JENNY (CONT'D)
               Oh did you guys not know? Wow, Ken.
               Me and my big ass computer know
               more about your tong than they do?
               Shame. Where'd the money go, huh?
               Up your nose?

     Ken, sensing he has to come clean --

                         KEN
               It's the dogs.
                   (sighs, then)
               If someone had kidnapped my
               Jonathan, God rest his soul --

     Ken looks to a FRAMED PHOTO of a beautiful golden retriever.

                         KEN (CONT'D)
               I would've paid anything to get him
               back. But these people... they're
               monsters. Half of them never show
               up for their dogs. And the
               purebreds have issues, you know?
               Skin problems, kidney problems -- I
               gotta give Crispy an IV every
               goddamn day!

     CRISPY, an older purebred dog, is in the corner with an IV.

                         KEN (CONT'D)
               But what am I supposed to do?!

                         JENNY
               Give me Mr. Linguini. And as soon
               as I get my big beautiful
               Choochie's check, I'll give you
               enough money to solve all your
               problems. Do we have a deal?

     Ken looks at Jenny, conflicted...

93                                                             93
     EXT. CHOSEN FAMILY CANINE RESCUE - DAY

     Jenny, clutching Linguini, runs for her car. Ken, his guys,
     and dogs chase her. She ducks throwing stars. It's CHAOS.

     EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY

     QUICK POPS OF:

     Anne and Francine walking through the iconic studio gates and
     fountain, past a HARRIED ASSISTANT carrying a pyramid of boba
     drinks.

     Some CREW carrying a LARGE, STRANGE PIECE OF SET DEC.

     A GOLF CART goes by, with a WEIRD CHARACTER on the back of
     it, drinking a boba tea. Francine stares, perplexed. Anne
     pulls her along.

               And you can just follow me this way
               to the green room --

     Anne notices -- THE HALLWAY IS LINED WITH ALL OF TERRY'S
     BOWTIES. Mercedes notices Anne's awe.

                         MERCEDES (CONT'D)
               Pretty amazing, right? You know
               he's never worn the same one twice.

     Anne stops in front of a specific bowtie, which eagle-eyed
     viewers will recognize from the show Anne was watching when
     her dad left in the opening.

     She looks at it for an emotional beat.

     INT. STUDIO - BACKSTAGE - LATER

     Anne stands, in her show outfit and hair and make-up, while a
     sound guy mics her. She hears, approaching --

                         RON HEACOCK (O.S.)
               Big show tonight! Here we go!

     She turns and sees RON HEACOCK, in the flesh, smiling
     broadly, greeting crew members as if he's the mayor. And
     wearing a bowtie. Anne glares at the bowtie. Ron sees her.

                         RON HEACOCK (CONT'D)
               Oh hi there! I'm Ron. I'd shake
               your hand but...

               Did you have a good flight? Great,
               great. Hey I want to apologize.

     Anne looks at him, thrown by the kindness.

                         ANNE
               Why?

                         RON HEACOCK
               Well, you're obviously a huge fan
               of the show, and it's such a bummer
               that you finally get to be here and
               the whole night is just going to be
               all about me winning my 84th game
               and becoming the longest running
               champion. It's so unfair to you.

     Ron starts off. Anne blurts --

                         ANNE
               Do you want to be Terry? Is that

                         RON HEACOCK
               What? Terry is beloved by the
               entire world.

          I would be crazy to think I could
          ever fill his shoes. And I'm not
          pretending, I really am nice.

          Well I won't keep ya, I know you
          need to get into hair and make-up.

          Oh.
              (noticing)
          There he is!

Anne turns to see: TERRY. IN THE FLESH. WALKING UP TO THEM.
Anne stares, completely gobsmacked. Terry smiles warmly at
Anne, so humble and kind.

                    TERRY
          Hello, Anne. I'm Terry.

Anne's eyes bulge a little. Did he really just say her name?

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          Welcome to the show. Your video was
          very impressive.

                    RON HEACOCK
          Yeah, it was freakishly great.

Terry looks at Ron, clocking the bowtie. We can tell there's
a hint of contempt, but Terry is a consummate professional so
it's well-hidden.

                    TERRY
          Hello, Ron.

                    RON
          See you onstage, Terry.

Ron winks, moving off towards the stage. We hear cheers from
the crowd as he walks out. Terry turns back to Anne.

                    TERRY
          Remember, we're here to learn and
          have fun. Don't worry about

He goes onstage. As he walks out, the studio audience CHEERS!

      INT. STUDIO - CSQ SET - MOMENTS LATER

      Anne is at her podium. She looks to Ron Heacock, who's
      primping. She glances at LEAH, the third contestant, who's
      waving at her FAMILY in the audience.

      She eyes Terry, across the stage. He gives her a supportive
      thumbs up. She almost barfs. He looks concerned.

      A STAGE MANAGER, GLENN, calls from behind camera:

                          GLENN
                We're live in five, four, three...

                meet tonight's contestants. Of
                course we all know our returning

                for the record tonight.

                          RON HEACOCK
                Oh is that tonight?

      The audience laughs. Terry politely chuckles.

                          TERRY
                And I see you've stolen my look.

                          RON HEACOCK
                Well Terry, it's a big night, and I
                wanted to honor you.

      The audience awws.

                          TERRY
                Thank you. Also joining us tonight
                is someone you might recognize from
                your computers, the famous Quiz
                Lady. Welcome, Anne.

      Anne, lost in panic, flinches at the sound of her name.

                           ANNE
                What?

                ... and welcome Leah, from Cedar
                Rapids, Iowa. Best of luck. Let's

          May I have five minutes on the
          clock please? And your time...
          starts... NOW!

Anne reflexively reaches to put a hand on Mr. Linguini, just
like she always does, but he's not there.

                    TERRY (CONT'D)
          The Striding Man is the logo of

          Johnnie--

At the same time, Ron buzzes in. Anne forgot to buzz!

                    RON HEACOCK
          Johnnie Walker.

                    TERRY
          Correct! Who wrote Jane Eyre?

Anne tries to buzz but DROPS HER BUZZER. Leah buzzes in.

          Emily Bronte.

                      TERRY

Leah's score drops to -100. Ron buzzes in --

                    RON HEACOCK
          So close, Leah! But it was actually
          Charlotte Bronte.

Anne glares at Ron, hating the condescension.

                    TERRY
          Correct! What does an oologist
          study?

Anne, still distracted by Ron, buzzes in.

                      ANNE

                           TERRY
                I did. What NBA team holds the
                record for most wins in a season?
                     (Ron buzzes in)
                Ron.

      Ron clocks that Anne is completely blank. He grins.

      INT. CSQ STUDIO - DAY

      Leah is at 0. Anne is at -100. Ron is at 23,000. Less than 20
      seconds left on the clock!

                          TERRY
                What qualitative scale is used to
                rate minerals in terms of scratch
                resistance?

      Ron and Leah think, no idea. Anne, caught up in self-
      loathing, takes a second to register the question, but then
      realizes -- it's about rocks! She buzzes in.

                          ANNE
                Mohs Hardness Scale!

          ones.

          Wow. When we return, Ron and Anne
          will compete Head to Head! Don't go
          anywhere. I know I won't.

                    GLENN
          ... and we're out!

Leah is ushered offstage. Terry comes over to Anne.

                    TERRY
          Are you ok? You seem deeply unwell.

Anne manages a nod. Terry moves off. And then Anne hears--

                    JENNY (O.S.)
          Get your hands off me! I need to
          get in there, it's an emergency!

                    ANNE
          LINGUINI!!!

She drops to her knees and holds out her arms. Mr. Linguini
stands there for a second. Anne's smile falters -- has he
forgotten her? But then... his TAIL WAGS. He hobbles to her.

                    ANNE (CONT'D)
          Oh Linguini I missed you so much!
              (to Jenny)

          no way I can win the money. Quick,

          out of here. Do the fries thing!
                       Pink (05/25/2022)                  95.

Anne picks up Linguini and tries to bolt for the door.

                    JENNY
          No. I am not letting you run away.
          You can do this. You know why?

                    ANNE
          Because I'm strong?

                    JENNY
          Because you know this game. Just
          like you know literally everything
          else. So play the same way you
          always have. Like a winner.

A beat as Anne takes this in.

                    GLENN
          Thirty seconds everybody!

Anne, clutching Mr. Linguini, goes to her mark.

                    RON HEACOCK
          You can't have a dog up here!

Anne looks down, she forgot she was holding him.

                    ANNE
          Oh, sorry, I --
              (then, confident)
          You know what? I want him with me.
          And I don't care if that's weird.
              (then, less confident)
          Is it okay if he's with me?

                    TERRY
          Gosh I don't know. No one's ever
          asked that before. Glenn, can she --

                    GLENN
          No. We're live in fifteen!

A PA comes to take Mr. Linguini away. Anne hesitates.

                    JENNY

          famous Quiz dog with her, right?

      People slowly join until the audience and crew are all
      chanting. Glenn, SO overwhelmed and annoyed, finally snaps --

          contestants that night, Oscar from
          Texas. He and I had the most
          wonderful conversation about how he
          makes his own jam. He liked to try
          wild combinations like blueberry
          rhubarb. He was like an artist, but
          with jam.

          glad I got to meet them. And that
          they got a chance to play.

          Don't ruin what might be your only
          night here by making it all about

          nine in order to win. And your
          time. Starts. Now!

Anne looks at the audience, the cameras, Terry... all staring
at her. Her nightmare. She looks at the first clue -- "STOCK
MARKET". Panicking, she mimes being locked in wooden stocks.

                    JENNY
          Dead? Melting!

Anne feels dumb, waves it off. Tries something else. She
mimes a STORK by flapping wings and then cradling a baby.

                       JENNY (CONT'D)
          Bird baby!

Anne waves it off.. Panic is setting in! But then she sees
TERRY. He gives her a nod. Keep going.

Anne takes a deep breath to reset. And then, gets an idea...
she mimes a BORING OLD MAN. She looks INSANE.

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          Uncle Dong?

Anne nods! She goes back into Uncle Dong mode and mimes
droning on and on about something boring.

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          The stock market!
                        Yellow (05/27/2022)             106.

Next clue: "KRISTI YAMAGUCHI". Anne points at Jenny, mimes
desperately praying, then does a figure skating flourish.

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          Kristi Yamaguchi!!!

Next clue: KETCHUP. Anne points at Jenny and mimes a martial
arts kick.

                    RON HEACOCK
          How is that ketchup???

DING! Next clue: THE BEATLES. Anne points at Jenny and mimes
being confused, like "this isn't good", does a thumbs down.

                    JENNY
          Me! What? Bad! The Beatles!!

DING! Next clue: GLUESTICK. Anne points at herself and mimes
putting on chapstick and not being able to open her mouth.

                       JENNY (CONT'D)
          Gluestick!

DING! Next clue: CHEESECAKE. Anne mimes: "me? No. You? Oh
hell yeah"

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          You no me oh hell yeah cheesecake!

Ron is flabbergasted -- how are they doing this?! He looks to
Bart, like "can you believe this??" but Bart is just intently
studying them, trying to figure out how they're so good.

Next clue: SHADOW. Anne looks sad and holds up her hand as if
she's a dog with a hurt paw.

                    JENNY (CONT'D)
          The sad old dog from Homeward
          Bound! Shadow!

                Umbrella woman! Umbrella man!
                Umbrella boy!!

      Anne panics, the clock is ticking!!! Suddenly, Anne gets an
      idea! She mimes digging a hole and squatting over it.

                          JENNY (CONT'D)
                Shit in a hole?

                          TERRY
                Oops, no swearing!

                          JENNY
                Shoot! Shoot in a hole!

      Anne mimes: "not me. You!"

                          JENNY (CONT'D)
                Embarrassed! Starbucks! TANKINI!

      Anne panics -- time is almost out!! She gets down, makes
      herself look small and scared, then points at Jenny, and
      steps in front of "little kid Anne", posing like a superhero.

      Jenny realizes what the word is. It means so, so much to her.

                          JENNY (CONT'D)
                Hero?

      Anne looks at her. Yeah. Hero. THE END OF ROUND BUZZER

      still livid.

      Terry comes on stage to join Anne and Jenny.

                Well folks, we have a new champion--

                          RON HEACOCK
                No no no no no NO! She cheated! She
                brought a dog, she changed
                partners, they used some like
                ancient Chinese mindmeld--

                          JENNY
                    (gasp, to herself)
                Actual racism.

                          TERRY
                None of that is against the rules.
                You could've changed your partner.

                          RON HEACOCK
                    (sarcastic)
                Oh yeah I'm gonna pay Bart to be
                here and not use him. Just admit
                it, Terry. You wanted me to lose.
                You've always been threatened by
                me!! Because I'm young and exciting
                and you're just a boring old man!!

      EVERYONE GASPS. Terry stares at Ron for a moment.

                          TERRY
                Buzz off, Ron.

      People are stunned! Terry smiles confidently at the camera.

                          TERRY (CONT'D)
                Would a boring old man say that?
                Congratulations Anne, you're our
                new Quiz champion!

      The audience rushes the stage! PAs try to hold them back, but
      then give up, swept up in joy. Bart ushers Ron off --
                      Green (06/03/2022)               108A.

                    RON HEACOCK
          This was supposed to be my night!

As the crowd surrounds Anne, Ron notices a KIND OLDER WOMAN
(maybe his mom?) in the wings holding up a RON WON t-shirt.
He snatches it out of her hands.

                    RON HEACOCK (CONT'D)
          Get this out of here! Weren't you
          paying attention?! I lost! It's
          over!

He cries into the t-shirt, getting make-up all over it.

On stage, Jenny starts a chant:

                    JENNY
          Anne! Anne! Anne!
                                                              109.

      Everyone joins in! Terry, delighted by it, yells over them:

                of fast facts and live learning!
                I'm Terry McTeer and I'll be right--

      He tries to jump to his mark, but Anne's fans are in the way.
      Terry laughs, kind of shrugs.

                          TERRY (CONT'D)
                Here. Have a good night!

      Terry looks at Anne, surrounded by her fans. Mr. Linguini is
      hoisted in the air. He smiles at her. Anne grins back.

                promise that I might get to play
                charades. And it was all A LIE!!!

                If you're gonna be this miserable,
                can you just die? You're ruining

                ever make your life better, because
                life is, and will always be --

      Francine notices something off-screen. Her eyes go WIDE,
      filled with REMARKABLE JOY.

Anne and Jenny follow her gaze and see --

PAUL REUBENS. Driving a golf cart. He's glistening in the
sunlight like a golden god.

Anne steps in front of the golf cart, forcing it to stop.

                    ANNE
          Hi! Scuse me. Sorry to bother you,
          but she is a huge fan.

She gestures to Francine, who is nearly catatonic.

                    PAUL REUBENS
          I love that story!

                    JENNY
          Maybe you could give her a ride in
          your golf cart?

He's hesitant. Anne sidles up to him.

                    ANNE
          Please? She's only got a month to
          live. She has a rare disease where
          her intestines grow like an
          invasive weed--

                    PAUL REUBENS

                          JENNY
                It wasn't your fault. They always
                thought we were the losers of the
                family.

       INT. CSQ STUDIO - HALL OF BOWTIES - DAY

       Terry and Anne are in the hallway, hanging up the bowtie from
       Anne's first game. Terry lets Anne do the honors. Terry and
       Anne became good friends. He even gave her the honors of
       hanging her first bowtie.

       Anne struggles to reach the spot where it's supposed to hang.
       Terry has to step in to help. Or he tried to, at least.

       INT. FANCY CORPORATE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

       We see JENNY, HER SKETCHY LAWYER, and ONE VERY ANNOYED FANCY
       LAWYER in a fancy corporate conference room holding an
       ENORMOUS NOVELTY CHOOCHIE'S CHECK, posing for a photo. Jenny
       finally got her Choochie's check! It was for truly an obscene
       amount of money. We see the amount on the check is BLURRED.

       INT. CHOSEN FAMILY CANINE RESCUE - BACK ROOM - DAY

       Ken opens an envelope. Jenny stayed true to her word and paid
       double what her mom owed. She even threw in a lifetime supply
       of free Choochie's. Ken holds up a SPARKLING RED CREDIT CARD.

      INT. CHOOCHIE'S - DAY

      Ken and his guys at a booth in Choochie's. They eat lunch
      there every day now. And they all get fajitas. Which are
      great! But it's hard when EVERYONE gets them, you know?

      Waiters struggle to place down several sizzling pans. Ken's
      guys try to make room, but there just isn't enough space.

      INT. BEN FRANKLIN INN & SPA - DAY

      Ben Franklin, using a quill pen, smiling with perfect teeth.
      Ben Franklin got his braces off and was able to live full
      time as a period-accurate Ben Franklin. He even stopped using
      phones and computers. That's all Tina's job now.

      We see, behind Ben Franklin, Tina is on the phone.

      INT. CSQ STUDIO - DAY

      FREEZE FRAME on Terry telling Ron to buzz off. Terry's "buzz
      off, Ron" became a wildly popular meme and cemented Terry as
      a cultural icon.

      EXT. BEAUTIFUL CALIFORNIA MANSION - DAY

      We find Jenny, in a tankini, lounging by a POOL. Jenny used
      (some of) her Choochie's money to buy a house in California.

      REVEAL Jenny's house is an insanely opulent ENORMOUS GAUDY
      MANSION. And she bought a matching one...

      We find a SMALLER VERSION OF THE SAME MANSION. For Mr.
      Linguini. REVEAL: Mr. Linguini is asleep inside/out front.
      Anne has her own guest wing at Jenny's.

      We find Anne reading in the garden.

      A UNIFORMED BUTLER brings Jenny a spa water. Jenny sits up to
      drink it and waves to Anne. Anne waves back. And Anne got a
      job where she's appreciated.

      INT. ANNE'S CSQ OFFICE - DAY

      Anne, at her computer, in the zone as she writes questions.

      set of CSQ, right after Anne won her first game.
