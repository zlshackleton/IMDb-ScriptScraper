    FADE IN:

1   EXT. HARVARD SQUARE PLAZA                                       1

    Early morning. Just after eight. The Plaza where people
    come up from the subway station. Some kiosks nearby.

    An ARMORED TRUCK idles in front of Out of Town News. The
    driver sits behind the wheel, taking slightly nervous
    stock of the morning scene.

    A CITY WORK TRUCK idles across from the bank.

    The COURIER (the guy who "couries" the dolly in and out
    of the bank) goes around to the back of the armored
    truck. He opens the door and pulls out a DOLLY and a
    METAL BOX. We see his SIDEARM on his hip.

    The Courier begins pushing the dolly across the plaza
    toward the bank. We TRACK WITH him. The walk winds
    around kiosks. He weaves through various PEDESTRIANS and
    LOITERERS, TRAVELERS, DRUGGIES, AND KIDS. We get the
    sense that something must be about to happen. It
    doesn't. Sees a SUSPICIOUS PERSON, passes him, nothing
    happens. Wends around a work truck stopped in front of
    the bank. Still nothing.

    The Courier reaches the bank doors.   Safety.   He opens
    the door and steps in.


2   INT. CAMBRIDGE MERCHANTS BANK - CONTINUOUS ACTION               2

    BOOM! With extraordinary violence, the Courier is
    SLAMMED in to as if by a savage HOCKEY CHECK by a MAN
    (DOUG) WHO is MASKED AND ARMED.

    THREE MORE ARMED, MASKED MEN move past them shouting:

                             MASKED MEN
               Empty your pockets! Take it out!

    The stunned employees are PUSHED BACK while the bandits
    quickly rifle their pockets for cell phones.

    A TOUGH THIEF (JEM) JUMPS THE COUNTER and goes after the
    employees in the back.

    A HEAVY THIEF (GLOANSY) zip ties the door.
    A LARGE THIEF (DEZ) gets cell phones from people in the
    front.

3    INT. BEHIND THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER                       3

     The employees are   gathered on the ground. GLOANSY is
     standing over the   employees, whose CELL PHONES and
     BLACKBERRIES have   been placed in a container and DOUSED
     WITH BLEACH. Jem    finishes the last drawer.

     Doug walks back, checks clock.

                               DOUG
               Bank manager.    Come on.

     Both CLAIRE KEESEY (30) and a man (her assistant manager,
     DAVID BEARNS) begin to rise.

     Doug points his rifle at BEARNS.

                             DOUG
               You're not the manager.

     Jem KICKS him.

    Everything has gone very fast to this point. Now it
    moves agonizingly slow -- They watch it like three people
    waiting for an elevator. 3, 2, 1.

    The timer CLACKS!   Doug inserts the vault key.

                            DOUG
              Don't enter the panic code.

    Claire reaches for the big dial with a trembling hand.
    She rotates it once, then overshoots the next number.

                             JEM
              Don't stall.

    Jem has his gun pointed at Bearns' head.   Claire makes a
    mistake and the TUMBLERS RESET.

              lefty or should I get someone
              else?

              You want us here another fifteen
              minutes?

    Claire reaches fast, but Doug grabs her wrist, holding it
    steady: it looks fragile in his gloved hand.

                            DOUG
              Once you start, do not stop.

    Claire reaches for the dial -- begins working the
    numbers. After the third turn, there's a CLACK. Jem
    spins the wheel and the vault door OPENS. He notices her
    whispering to herself.

                             DOUG
              What?

       TABLE are. A WORKER is there eating, not having realized
       they were being robbed. Dez KICKS his chair.

                               DEZ
                 Are you serious?

       puts all the DVR SECURITY RECORDERS into a microwave in
       the BREAK ROOM and turns the machine on. SPARKS.

       Doug alone in the vault. He takes a moment, then uses
       the KEY FROM THE GUARD to open a SAFE in the vault.

       It reveals BUNDLES OF CASH in various colored bands,
       yellow, blue, purple, brown.

       Doug starts fanning them and removing DYE PACKS and
       TRACERS, discarding them on the FLOOR.

              Front door.

    A STUDENT is trying to open the front door, pushing
    against the ZIP TIE around the entry doors.

    Doug's attention is pulled to Claire, lying face-down
    behind the teller cages.

    Her heel is slowly moving. Her foot PRESSES A BUTTON
    UNDER THE COUNTER -- then quickly glides back.

    Claire looks the other way... and sees Doug's mask
    STARING at her.

    She's caught.   She's dead.

    The student finally gives up, walking away.

    Doug stares at terrified Claire.   After a beat:

                              DOUG
              We gotta go.

              Bleach it up.

    Gloansy pulls ZIP CUFFS from his pocket. Jem throws Doug
    and Dez jugs of ULTRA CLOROX from the work bag and they
    begin DOUSING THE PLACE WITH BLEACH.

    Gloansy finishes the work of zip-tying Claire, Bearns and

    Jem HITS HIM WITH BUTT OF THE RIFLE, then again, then
    again. Bearns' head is bouncing between the floor and
    Jem's rifle, the stock tearing open a good piece of skin
    above his temple. Jem keeps hitting him.

    In his RAGE, the back of Jem's MASK COMES UP REVEALING A
    TATTOO UNDERNEATH: FIGHTING IRISH CHARACTER HOLDING A
    BAG OF MONEY.

    Bearns slumps to one side, but Jem does not let up.   He
    HAMMERS at Bearns' defenseless face.

    Jem rises, grabs a bottle of bleach. Moves to empty it
    over Bearns' face. But Doug HOOKS his arm, stopping him.

     a blindfold. He makes a fist and drives it -- STOPPING
     JUST SHORT OF HER NOSE. Making sure she can't see.

      Light dog seems almost to move in unison with him when
      Doug flicks his forearm to launch a puck up in the air
      and catch it on the blade as it falls.

      Doug lifts weights compulsively in his apartment as the
      sun rises. He goes until he can barely move. He has a
      TOWNIES tattoo.

      of the front of a vestibule. He stays across the street.
      We assume this man sells drugs. We get the sense this

      Doug just makes it for a five AM meeting. He walks past
      the half-empty FOOD BANK and into the meeting. Hard-core
      guys who need to be in a meeting at five. Rough. He
      sits back with a cup of coffee as the RAGGED SPEAKER gets
      going and closes his eyes...

                Janice, she's my wife. You want
                to know what happened? I was a
                dead person. It's like the guy at
                the bar -- he sees a priest pull
                up a chair. The guy says to the
                priest, `you're wasting your time.
                I know for a fact there is no
                God.' Priest says, `How?' He
                says, `I was an explorer at the
                North Pole. I got lost in a storm
                once, I was blinded and freezing
                to death and I prayed, if there's
                a God, save my life.' The priest
                looked at him confused and says,
                `but you're alive... God saved
                you.' Guy said, `God? No, God
                never showed up. That's what I'm
                saying! Some Eskimo came along
                and took me back to his camp.'

     populated by immigrants mid-game behind Claire. She digs
     in the dirt as Doug watches her, sitting on a wood beam.

               This sound woke me up. I thought
               it was an animal. I'd never heard
               a man cry. When I saw my father
               in the kitchen all I remember is
               the ashtray. A hundred
               cigarettes. Ash like a little
               mountain. He stopped crying and
               he was sitting there watching TV
               on our little black and white with
               no sound. I think he just didn't
               know what else to do. He saw me
               standing in the doorway and he
               just goes, `your mother left.
               She's not comin' back.' Just like
               that. Smokin' cigarettes and
               eatin' a TV dinner at six in the
               mornin'.

               To this day my father will tell
               you he helped me make those
               posters. But he didn't. He sat
               there and drank a case of beer and

               let myself think that was where
               she went. But somewhere along the
               line I came to terms with the fact
               that if she left, it was for a
               reason, she didn't want to be my
               mother and she wasn't coming back.

               got a second chance and I blew
               that, too. When it was over for
               me I wasn't smart enough to see it
               or classy enough to accept it. So
               I did a lot that make things
               worse. I look at that picture and
               see a kid who thinks he knows

     Obviously, he has been fantasizing about what he would do

     A van is parked up on a sidewalk so the minivan is forced

     The cruiser gives chase around several incredibly narrow,
     ancient turns and alleys -- built to accommodate horses
     (and even those only narrowly) in the 1700's. Driving
     though at 60 mph is harrowing.

     At one point the cruiser pushes the guys' tail, the car
     spins and they SHOOT THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. Then
     they turn the car around and continue on. Another
     CRUISER joins the pursuit at this point. Another cruiser
     comes down a perpendicular street and Doug stands up out
     the side door and FIRES at that one while Gloansy BACKS
     OUT and turns around. ONE CRUISER continues pursuit.

                so hard that you were throwing up.
                All over the parlor. So I told
                you if you looked around you might
                find her, to give you an activity.
                I didn't think you would carry it
                like a fuckin' disease. You want
                to think she was an angel -- go
                ahead. But look out your front
                door. How many twenty-two-year-
                old girls are out there -- fucking
                around, with kids they don't want
                and no sense in their head? Your
                mother wasn't no different.
                That's the hard truth. I made my
                peace with it. Make yours. I
                didn't look for her `cause there
                was nothin' to find.

      Doug comes down the street in a hurry. He turns the
      corner and stops in front of Claire's DOOR. He is FROZEN
      by something O.S.

      A FUNERAL ARRANGEMENT rests against Claire's door. There
      is no name on it, just her address, 321 MONUMENT AVE. We
      recognize this as a brand from the Florist's.

      Doug's heart drops. He rings her buzzer.    She doesn't
      answer. He POUNDS the door. No answer.

      He takes out his gun, BREAKS THE GLASS, opens the lock
      and goes in.

      He moves through the apartment with stealth.

      Through the front living area, to a back hall and
      ultimately into the bedroom.

      Doug stands in the bedroom, sensing something. He moves
      to the bathroom, sees the door slightly AJAR and a SHADOW
      on the FLOOR. He PUSHES IT OPEN slowly.

      We REVEAL:    CLAIRE, SITTING ON THE FLOOR, she's been
      crying.

      Doug quickly sticks the gun away and moves toward her.
      She PULLS away.

      Jem and Doug head down the hall and turn a corner to see:

      Two ARMED SECURITY PERSONNEL in CASHCOM shirts stand
      talking to a YOUNGER SECURITY GUARD, ERIC, in a RED
      SHIRT. Doug starts at them, his voice BOOMING inside the
      tunnel.

      calls loudly to the security guys inside the cash room.
      They cannot be seen but can surely hear Doug.

      Doug and Jem emerge from a SECURITY DOOR into the public
      section of the park. The game is a long way away, so
      there are very few people around. Stores are being
      cleaned and prepped. A few carts go by with kegs of
      beer.

      Doug and Jem, dressed as police officers, wheel a DOLLY
      which carries a DUFFEL FULL OF FOUR MILLION IN CASH.
      They go under a series of large beams in the open
      causeway.

      They enter the narrower tunnel with outlets to the
      seating. No one seems to take much notice of them.

      They approach an IDLING AMBULANCE sitting near a HALF
      OPEN VEHICLE BAY which affords access out of the park.

      On the other side of the bay is the idling ARMORED TRUCK,
      waiting for the courier (who is zip-tied in the cash
      room). We see the DRIVER reading the paper and watch our
      guys pass in his SIDE MIRROR.

      As they come up to the side of the ambulance, Doug knocks
      on the side deliberately three times. A moment later the
      door OPENS A CRACK, revealing GLOANSY and DEZ and a
      HANDCUFFED AND GAGGED EMT. Doug nods to him.
      They open the door wider and begin loading the bags into
      the ambulance.

      isn't right. As the guys continue loading, he backs away
      from the ambulance and realizes the place is EERILY
      QUIET.

      It seems like the level of activity has abated almost
      entirely in the park.

      He raises his empty weapon at the police who light him
      up. He SLUMPS to his seat. Realizing he isn't dead, he

      Doug replaces his empty clip with a new one, chambering a
      round. He opens his shirt and checks to see that the
      VEST HAS SAVED HIM FROM SEVERAL HITS -- HE IS OKAY.

      He kneels next to Fergie who lies on the floor and puts
      his gun in the florist's CROTCH and looks him in the eye.

      Doug parks the bus at another bus depot and gets off.


191   EXT. TRAIN STATION - TEN MINUTES LATER                        191

      Doug gets on an Amtrak train -- sign indicates its

192   EXT. BACK OF CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - THIRTY MINUTES LATER        192

      Claire sits on her back stairs. Several other agents lie
      in wait. Frawley stands in the inside of the foyer.
      Checks his watch.

      He smiles.    He gets it.   Walks out into the yard.

      He gestures to the assembled task force.

193   EXT. CHARLESTOWN STREET - HOUR LATER                          193

      Frawley, somewhat deflated, going to his car. A kid on a
      bicycle rides away. Moving away from two other agents.
      As he approaches, he sees something WEDGED into his
      ANTENNAE. He pulls it out, it is a PIECE OF PAPER FOLDED
      OVER. He opens it, small grimace. It reads, plainly:
      "GO FUCK YOURSELF." He smiles. Claire's Lawyer walks
      out. Frawley hands him the note.

                              FRAWLEY

      Doug is in his seat. He looks out the window of the
      train as the ocean passes by and day's last light breaks
      against New England rocks. He won't see anything like it
      for a long time.


195   EXT. CHARLESTOWN GARDENS - CLAIRE'S PLOT - DAYS LATER         195

      Claire is digging, hits something, reaches down.

      She lifts up a BAG OF MONEY, THEN A NOTE.   We hear Doug's
      voice from the note.

                              DOUG (V.O.)
                I just want you to keep enough of
                this to buy a train ticket... even
                if you never use it.

      She pulls out a TANGERINE which was buried in the earth.

                              DOUG (V.O.)
                If you decide you want to find me,

      SUPERIMPOSE:   10 MONTHS LATER

      The newly renovated Boys and Girls Club hockey rink
      shines. Everything about it feels new. Even the "Local
      Heroes" case, where one picture is noticeably absent.

      The little kids half skate around the ice, swimming in
      new pads and helmets.

      She looks to the rail on the hockey rink.   A small,
      rectangular gold plaque:

      "RENOVATIONS IN MEMORY OF DORIS MACRAY."

      Claire sits in the bleachers and watches the pee-wees as
      they shriek and clack their sticks -- remarking inwardly
      that from now on she would do the same with her life that
      she did with her garden discovery; see what she finds in
      the dirt and make it something good.


197   INT. CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY                      197

      Claire looks at her refrigerator. A TRAIN TICKET TO
      FLORIDA is stuck to it, grayed and fraying.
