   That's good cloud. Oh hello there, allow me to
   introduce myself. Seymour S. Sassafras at your
   service. The bees are buzzing, the flowers are
flowering, and spring has almost sprung, when Peter
 Cottontail will be hopping down the bunny trail.

                        BEE
                Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz

                          SSS
 Great chammering chim checks! You've never heard of
                  Peter Cottontail?

                         BEE
                      Bzz bzz.

                           SSS
The chief Easter Bunny? He defeated Irontail and saved
   Easter from disappearing forever! Does any of this
 ring a bell? No? Well surely you've heard of the son,
                  Peter Cottontail Jr.

                         BEE
                Bzz bzz bzz, bzz bzz!

                          SSS
My dear bee, you're in for an incredible treat. You're
  about to hear the story of how Peter Cottontail Jr.
        saved the world from permanent winter.

                         BEE
          Bzz bzz! Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz
                           SSS
          Well no, there isn't a bee in it.

                          BEE
               Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzzzzzz!

                         SSS
                No, I won't add one.

                         BEE
             Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz

                         SSS
  (talking over bee) Because, they sting people and
  interrupt me while I'm trying to tell my story.

                         BEE
                Bzz bzz bzz, bzz bzz!

                         SSS
            Hang on to your hat! Our story
           begins...NOOOOOOWWWWW!!!!!!!!!

The bee having popped his balloons, Seymour falls to
the ground below, where he comically falls into a
barrel and begins floating down a pink lemonade river.

                          SSS
    Here we are, April Valley. Where all the magic
happens. Easter magic that is. And everybody's getting
                ready for the big day!

MUSIC BREAK: INTRO SONG

                          ELROY
                  Good news, sir...

                       ANTOINE
                    Peteeeeer!

                        PETER
Huh, what? Antoine, Call maintenance. A lever on the
             control panel is missing.

                      ANTOINE
                  Right away sir!

                       ELROY
  Mr. Cottontail, our productivity is up over one
  tenth of one percent over the last three days.

                       PETER
                So that's...   good?

                        ELROY
              Yes sir, that's good.

                       PETER
          And we'll be ready for Easter?

                       ELROY
 By a whisker. I really had to light a fire under
             that marshmallow cream...

                        PETER
               (gasps) Light a fire?!

                         ELROY
          It's just a figure of speech sir.
                          PETER
                     (sniffs air)

                           ELROY
                  Uhh... fire! Fiiire!

                        PETER
 Don't worry everyone, it's just a figure of speech.

                        ELROY
                     No, FIRE!

Peter grabs a fire extinguisher and uses it to skate
down to the fire like a badass. He puts out the
fire.

                         PETER
  Now! Who was supposed to be watching the nougat?
            Come on, somebody speak up.

                  FACTORY WORKER
 Actually sir, a lot of us have been wondering...

                        PETER
                      ...yes?

                   FACTORY WORKER
                  What is nougat?




                        PETER
  Nougat. You know, it's-it's nougat, it's fluffy.
   It's chewy, it's partially hydroge-- hey, wait a
   minute. I want a name! who's responsible? Elroy?
                 who's responsible?

                       ELROY
Don't make me say, sir, please. It'll only make you
                      angry.

                       PETER
        Oh no. It was Junior... JUNIOR!!!!

                          SSS
  Sounds like Junior's in a little bit of trouble.
   Don't worry about the nougat, they made more.

Cut to: a grassy field, where Peter Cottontail
Junior is showing his friends one of his new
inventions.

                          JR
    Ladies and gentlemen! For generations, Easter
 bunnies have delivered eggs the old-fashioned way:
hopping down ye olde bunny trail. Today friends, we
   welcome the FUTURE. I give you Peter Cottontail
Junior's supercharged Easter basket speed shooter!

                          CHUNK
                        Wooooow!

                        SOPHIE
                         Cool!

                      JUNIOR
             Let's make bunny history.

He shoots, he splats.
                         SOPHIE
            Or we could make an omelet.

                       CHUNK
            Awesome! Can we do me next?

                        JUNIOR
 The problem must be an imbalance between the drag
      coefficient and the lift coefficient.

                        CHUNK
                W--what's that mean?

                       JUNIOR
                      No idea.

                       SOPHIE
              Maybe that's the problem?

                         PETER
                        Junior!

                        SOPHIE
              Gotta hop! He's so busted!

                        PETER
 Whew! (clears throat) Now. Junior. you missed all
     the excitement down at the candy factory.

                       JUNIOR
 I think you're the one missing the excitement Dad.
Check this out-- it's a little something I call... the
                      future.
                       PETER
       The future looks kind of icky, son.

                     JUNIOR
             Okay, needs some work.

                      PETER
 Let's talk about work. Like watching the nougat
                      vat.

                      JUNIOR
             What is nougat anyway?

                       PETER
  Nougat, you know it's nougat! It's fluffy, it's
chewy, it's partially hydrogenated-- it's the stuff
 you were supposed to be watching, but because you
           weren't, it caught on fire!

                      JUNIOR
                 Oh. That nougat.



                      PETER
  (sigh) Why does it seem like wherever you go,
  trouble is always hopping behind 1    qyou?

                      JUNIOR
               Give me one example!

                        PETER
 Let's see, there was the automatic basket weaving
thingamabobble, a daffodil weeding whatchamacallit,
  and who can forget the electronical egg painting
                   doohickey!

                      JUNIOR
     Dad I said one example, that was three.

                       PETER
 Junior, being head Easter Bunny isn't all fun and
games. Have I ever told you the story of Irontail?

            PETER AND JUNIOR (TOGETHER)
 His evil trickery almost ruined Easter forever...

                        PETER
           Have I told you this before?

                       JUNIOR
                  Once or twice.

                       PETER
        He and I were bitter enemies! and--

                      JUNIOR
(interrupting) Dad, that Iron Tail story is ancient
              history, get over it!

                       PETER
 Ughhh. Okay, I just hope you never have to learn
 about him the hard way. Now pick up your toys and
                    come home.

                       JUNIOR
   Toys! My inventions are the future of Easter!
                          PETER
 The future, the future, the future! Son, we've got
our paws full with the present! And we're doing just
fine without your... improvements. Now don't keep your
                    mother waiting.

                        JUNIOR
 Ugh, he doesn't get it! weed the flowers one at a
time, Junior. Paint the eggs as slooow as possible,
      Junior. Do everything my way, Junior.

MUSIC BREAK: I'M READY

                        JUNIOR
                   I'm ready, dad.

New scene. We see a wintery town. Close up on a little
human girl looking out of her window.

                          SSS
  Outside of April Valley the world is wrapped in
winter, and kids everywhere are more than ready for
                      Spring.

                    HUMAN GIRL
          Mom, will winter ever be over?

                      HUMAN MOM
We'll know spring is coming when Jack Frost's window
    paintings melt away! So it might be a while.

Suddenly there is a super sexy blue lady floating past
the window, just out of view of the humans.
                         JACKIE
Jack Frost? Darling please. Dear old Jack is so last
                     century.

She uses her magical ice powers to make the window
frostier.

                       JACKIE
   The names Jackie, Jackie Frost. Write it down.

Suddenly a ray of sun shines through a cloud,
melting the icy window.

                        JACKIE
Argh! Infernal sunshine ruining another masterpiece!

Jackie whistles and a flying car, driven by a
penguin, pulls up in midair. She gets in.

                        JACKIE
  Home, fish breath. And this time no stopping for
                    squid tacos.

Cut to: the Cottontail home. Peter and Mrs.
Cottontail are making dinner.

                       PETER
  Why is he in such a hurry to improve everything?

                   MRS. COTTONTAIL
     He takes after you, Peter, he's impatient!

                        PETER
He's got to slow down a little. A Bunny's got a walk
                 before he can hop.
                    MRS. COTTONTAIL
 If you were his age and all you got to do was pull
   weeds and watch pots boil, you'd try to change
                     things too.

                      PETER
                 Hey, at his age--

                   MRS. COTTONTAIL
             Not with your mouth full.

                       PETER
     (swallows) At his age, I was responsible!

                   MRS. COTTONTAIL
 Right, responsible for goofing off, sleeping late,
              dreaming the day away...

                        PETER
                   Exactly-- hey!

                  MRS. COTTONTAIL
 Peter, give Junior some real responsibility! He's
 not a little kid anymore. There must be something
              you could have him do.

                       PETER
 Well, of course it... No...yeah-- yeah! I got it!

Cut to a clock tower on a hill. Peter and Junior are
walking towards it.

                       JUNIOR
   You have got to be kidding. I'm supposed to get
          excited about cleaning a clock?

                       PETER
 Son, this is the clock of Spring, one of the four
      clocks of the seasons Father Time made.

            PETER AND JUNIOR (together)
  Without the four clocks, the seasons would never
                      change.

                       PETER
  ...never...change. Have I told you this before?

                        JUNIOR
Once or twice. But Dad, just polishing the outside?

                        PETER
 And inside. Polishing the most important part, the
                  spring of Spring.

                        JUNIOR
Yeah but, can't I, you know, trick it out a little?
    take it from analog to digital, slap on some
subwoofers, really make the bass tones pop? (starts
                    beatboxing)

                        PETER
    No nonono, no improving, no trick outing, no
upgrading. Look, what I'm about to give you is very,
very big. Huge, huge. The big time! It-- it literally
   is time and it's very big. It's the big time.

                       JUNIOR
                   What was that?

                        PETER
                Nothing. Here we go.

With reluctance, Peter hands Junior the key to the
all-important clock of Spring, putting the power to
control the weather in the hands of his adolescent
son.


                      JUNIOR
 You're giving me the key to the clock of Spring?

                         PETER
 Uh... yeah. Don't lose it. Obviously, right? And do
 not-- do not leave the case unlocked! If anything
                      happens--

                       JUNIOR
      (interrupting) I know, I'm responsible!

                       PETER
Yes, that is absolutely right, I'm counting on you,
  son. (Peter walks away) Good, he's responsible.
       Okay. Yup, this is good... Real good.

Unseen, an evil-looking bat watches the two from
atop the clock tower.

                     MONTRESOR
                 (chuckles evilly)
 Interior, Jackie's ice palace. She is standing next
to an ice chaise with penguin guards and butlers
holding icy drinks on a tray.

                        JACKIE
  I've had enough! I can't bear to watch that awful
sun melt away another one of my masterpieces! I wish
         there were no such thing as spring.

MUSIC BREAK: ICE LIFE

                        JACKIE
       Why can't it be winter all year long?

                      IRONTAIL
                Perhaps I can help?

                       JACKIE
        Guards! Intruder! Identify yourself.

                       IRONTAIL
 The name's Tail. Irontail. (make metal tail noise)

                       JACKIE
         Irontail! Like Irontail Irontail?

                      IRONTAIL
                    In the fur.

                       JACKIE
And what brings you to my frozen paradise, my metal-
                  tushied friend?

                        IRONTAIL
  What if I told you that I have a way to make sure
             Spring never comes again?

                       JACKIE
       Hmm. I'd wonder what's in it for you.

                       IRONTAIL
 Revenge. Peter Cottontail stole my job. If I can't
be the Easter Bunny then I'll make sure that Easter
                 never comes again.

                        JACKIE
        Hmmm. You've got my full attention.

                        IRONTAIL
    Good. Now then... There's this clock in April
                       Valley...

Cut to the clock of Spring. Junior is outside,
absorbed in his catapult.

                        JUNIOR
 Ready, aim, and happy easter!.......Hmm. Improved
   velocity, decreased accuracy. Highly unusual.

                      IRONTAIL
          One more time, what's the plan?

                       JACKIE
      Sshh. Get in, get the spring, get out!

                       JUNIOR
  Excuse me, but you're not supposed to be here.

                      IRONTAIL
 (to Jackie) No magic, you'll give us away. I'll take
 care of this. (to Junior) Bless my whiskers, don't
  tell me! you're the very picture of your father,
                 Peter Cottontail.


                      JUNIOR
             I'm sorry, do I know you?

                       IRONTAIL
Oh dear boy, I grew up here. But I've been far away,
 and I've brought some friends to see dear old April
                        Valley.

                      JACKIE
             Say freeze! (snaps photo)

                       JUNIOR
Those are some strange-looking bunnies, and, whoa,
  that is one very fluffy tail, mister... um...?

                     IRONTAIL
    Don't tell me, a new egg delivery system?

                      JUNIOR
          It's just a prototype, really.

                      IRONTAIL
Brilliant! So original! Of course, new ideas aren't
     really appreciated around here, are they?

                        JUNIOR
        No! I mean-- hey, how did you know?

                     IRONTAIL
   Oh you could say we're two of a kind, you and I.
     Inventors, innovators, unappreciated by the
riffraff. Oh, I can see when a bright young bunny is
     being cheated out of his chance to shine.

                       JUNIOR
                      You can?

Meanwhile inside the clock, the penguins are trying
to steal the spring, but failing comically.

                        JUNIOR
   My dad never listens to me. He just wants to do
 things the same old way they've always been done.

                     IRONTAIL
Your father understands so very little. Now show me
              how this marvel works.

                       JACKIE
      Ugh! Do I have to do everything myself?

She shoots an ice ray, freezing all the clock's
inner works.

                       JUNIOR
 ...and then you have to adjust the tension on the
          spring. Too much tension is bad.

                       IRONTAIL
                You're telling me.

Inside the clock tower, Jackie conjures a crowbar
made of ice and dislodges the spring.
                        JUNIOR
 ...But it's got to have enough thrust to get your
payload where it's going! ...I'm still working on--

                       SOPHIE
 Hey, Junior! The calendar day ceremony's about to
                      start!

                       CHUNK
            Hurry up, Spring's comin'!

                       JUNIOR
            But I gotta finish up here!

                       SOPHIE
        Well... we don't want to be late.

                       CHUNK
          How about we save you a place?

                       JUNIOR
                    Wait, guys!

                       IRONTAIL
  Don't worry, Junior, I'll finish polishing the
                      clock.

                       JUNIOR
                     You will?


                       IRONTAIL
                  With pleasure.

                      JUNIOR
             Um... you're gonna need this.

Junior hands Irontail the shiny key to the clock.

                        JUNIOR
             Thanks. Hey guys, wait up!

                        IRONTAIL
  Polishing it off that is... (evil laugh) Oh you'll
bring big changes to April Valley all right, Junior.
                  Big, big changes.

The chauffeur penguin pulls up, they all hop in
Jackie's car and ride away evilly.
...Cut to new scene: All the bunnies are gathered in
the town center for the calendar day ceremony!

                         PETER
  Welcome friends, to another happy calendar day!

                       JUNIOR
 Whoops, excuse me! Comin' through! That's my dad.

                       PETER
  Now, how about we all say goodbye to March, and
                  hello to April!

Drumroll. Peter rips off the calendar page that says
thirty one to reveal... thirty two!!??? The crowd
gasps as the sky darkens.

                        ELROY
 March thirtysecond? Theeeeeere's no such thing as
                March thirtysecond!
                        PETER
                     Wh..Wha-?

Peter rips off another page of the calendar.

                 BUNNY IN CROWD #1
                March thirty third?

Peter keeps ripping, but the numbers just keep going
higher. The month of March has become infinite.

                 BUNNY IN CROWD #2
March fifty first? Hey Cottontail, is this some kind
                      of joke?

                        ANTOINE
            Peter, March is not ending!

                       PETER
               Well, I can see that.

                       ANTOINE
          What has happened to ze April?

                        PETER
       I don't understand it, Antoine! Elroy!

A thunderclap. Storm clouds gather.

                        ELROY
 I've never seen anything quite like this. I don't
          know what could have happened.

                        PETER
              Unless...... Juniorrr!
 Junior has broken away from the crowd and in a panic
is sprinting up to the clock tower, panting heavily.

                         JUNIOR
 (heavy breathing... even more heaving breathing) Oh,
  Dad... I'm sorry. the key! Where did I put the key?
                 (more heavy breathing)

He comes upon the icy clock and rushes inside. His
worst fears are confirmed: the spring of Spring is
missing! He screams.

                         JUNIOR
                          Aah!

He runs back out into the storm.

                        JUNIOR
            (lots of ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

Cut to: Junior, alone in his dark kitchen, writing on
a piece of paper.

                        JUNIOR
  Dear Mom and Dad, this is all my fault. I made a
mistake. Now I've got to try to make things right. I
       hope you can forgive me, love, Junior.

                          PETER
 (reading) ---love, Junior. I shouldn't have been so
                    tough on him.

                         ELROY
Sir, it's the factory. The rain is causing a flood.
                         PETER
    Elroy, you. You're in charge of the factory.

                   MRS. COTTONTAIL
                      Peter?

                        PETER
   Antoine, you come with me. We're going to find
                      Junior!

It's dark and raining hard. Peter and Antoine are
standing on a bridge, over the formerly pink river.

                        PETER
                    Ya see him?

                       ANTOINE
  No Peter, I don't see him. Then again I'm three
          inches off ze ground. Hurry up!

Lightning strikes the bridge and it breaks in half,
stranding the two on opposite sides of the river.

                        PETER
            Antoine! I can't get across!

                       ANTOINE
  Never fear, Peter. I will find your boy. I will
bring him back. I will not fail. I swear it upon my
 honor as a caterpillar, and a citizen of France!
         Don't step on me anyone! I'm off!

New scene. Interior, ice palace. Jackie, Irontail,
the penguins, and Montresor the bat are all dancing
around to some sick techno music for slightly too
 long. Jackie and Irontail are getting slightly too
close for a children's movie.

                         JACKIE
   Penguins! Make my slightly mangy friend here a
                       drink.

                      IRONTAIL
                     A toast!

                       JACKIE
To the end of Spring. But wait! Even without Spring
   there's still Summer, and that's even worse!

                      IRONTAIL
Then why stop with Spring? We could just keep going,
                    you and I.

                       JACKIE
                Put Summer on ice?

                      IRONTAIL
            And put the freeze on Fall?

                      JACKIE
 I see the start of a beautiful partnership. Frost
                  and Irontail.

                      IRONTAIL
I think Irontail and Frost has a certain ring to it.

                       JACKIE
        How did you come by that, um, that--

                      IRONTAIL
  Riveted rump? Chrome caboose? Platinum posterior?

                       JACKIE
                    Yeah, that.

                        IRONTAIL
  Once upon a time, it was a lovely puff of a tail.
 And then a careless, hateful little child ran over
 it with his roller skates and lopped it clean off.
 And ever since that day, I have had to wear this.

                       JACKIE
 So you weren't always Irontail? What was your name
                   before that?

                        IRONTAIL
              Uh... I-I don't remember.

                       JACKIE
If we're going to be partners, you have to be honest
 with me. Even if we're going to be evil partners.

                      IRONTAIL
         I-It's really not that important.

A penguin whispers something into Jackie's ear.

                         JACKIE
              It's... Fluffy? (cackles)

                      PENGUINS
                       (laugh)

                       IRONTAIL
        I knew you were all going to laugh.
                       JACKIE
No no no, it's a fine name... Fluffy. We're going for
     a ride. Come along now penguins... Fluffy!

                      PENGUINS
                     (laughter)

Cut to a new, unfamiliar land. Our hero begins his
journey.

                      JUNIOR
                 (heavy breathing)

                      FLUTTER
                 Look ooooouuuuut!

A robin falls out of the sky and collides directly
with Junior.

                       FLUTTER
              Ooow, you hurt my beak!

                       JUNIOR
            What? You crashed into me!

                       FLUTTER
    And my feathers! You definitely scratched my
                     feathers!

                       JUNIOR
                Now wait, you just--

                      FLUTTER
And I itch now! Oh great, I think you gave me lice.
                       JUNIOR
                     Lice!?

                     MAMA ROBIN
My baby!!! What have you done to him? What were you
thinking? He's molting, he's smaller than the other
        birds, and you done gave him lice?

                      JUNIOR
       Actually, ma'am, he crashed into me.

                       MAMA ROBIN
And you! Don't you know rabbits can give you lice?
     ...So, dear, are you new to Summer Hill?

                      JUNIOR
     Yes, ma'am. I'm here from April Valley.

        FLUTTER AND MAMA ROBIN (together)
                 April Valley!?

                   MAMA ROBIN
     You a little far from home... aren't you?

                      FLUTTER
            What are you doing here?

                       JUNIOR
 I don't have time to explain. I have to find the
              clock of summer. Fast!

                   MAMA ROBIN
Don't worry baby, Flutter will show you the way.

                     FLUTTER
                        Mama!

                     MAMA ROBIN
Don't you mama me. You better mind your Summer Hill
 manners. Now, you crashed into this boy, so you're
     gonna go on, and you're gonna show him some
hospitality. Now I'm going to sit on your brother.

                       JUNIOR
                        Huh?

                      FLUTTER
              He's still in the egg.

                       JUNIOR
               That makes more sense.

Jump to, Junior and Flutter hurrying toward the
clock of summer. But the sky is already darkening.

                        JUNIOR
  ...and I think they're gonna try to do the same
 thing to the clock of summer that they did to the
                 clock of spring!

                      FLUTTER
                        Wow.

                       JUNIOR
           Yeah. Wow. Come on, let's go!

It's just as they feared. The clock is frozen and
dark clouds cover the sky. In a watermelon patch
beneath the clock, strange, muffled noises can be
heard.
                        CHIPMUNK
          Halp!...halp!...(struggle noises)

A frenzied chipmunk bursts forth from inside a
watermelon.

                      CHIPMUNK
 They jumped me from behind! They stole the sun of
   summer from inside the clock! Now summer won't
                       come!

                      FLUTTER
             Listen, I gotta get home.


                       CHIPMUNK
             The flowers won't flower!

                      FLUTTER
                My mom is calling,

                      CHIPMUNK
              The melons won't melon!

                      FLUTTER
                So I'm out of here.

                      CHIPMUNK
           The vegetables won't vegetate!

                      FLUTTER
                      See ya!

                      CHIPMUNK
               And eggs won't hatch!
 Flutter stops in his tracks, aghast. Now it's
personal.
...Cut back to April Valley, where snow is falling
from an icy sky.

                          ELROY
      The cold weather's making things difficult
     throughout our operations, sir. You see, the
  chickens can't lay eggs, the chocolate is frozen
solid, and the nougat, sir, well the nougat...don't--
   don't make me explain it, I can't describe it.

                       PETER
       (exasperated) Any sign of Junior yet?

                       ELROY
              Unfortunately, sir, no.

                       PETER
           I'm counting on you, Antoine.

Meanwhile, Antoine is wriggling as fast as he can
through a dark and cloudy summer hill.

                        ANTOINE
 (panting) Don't worry, Junior, I am on my way! Just
                      sit tight.

We cut to a new place with harmonica music and
cornstalks. A family of mice is scrounging for corn
cobs.

                       MUNCH
      (grunting) Okay, don't anyone help me!
                     PAPA MOUSE
   Munch, honey, leave it! There's nothing left.

                        MUNCH
            Maybe we could just lick it.

Suddenly a hungry looking cat appears.

                       MUNCH
                      (gulps)

                      PAPA MOUSE
                 Run for your lives!

                      MAMA MOUSE
                       Move it!

                        MUNCH
 What is it with cats anyhow? Why don't you open a
                 can or something?

Munch scurries behind some cornstalks and the cat
passes her by. She appears safe.

                        MUNCH
(panting) Just once I'd like to see the view from a
           few links up the food chain.

Just then we hear a raptor screech. A hawk swoops
down and grabs Munch with its talons!

                       MUNCH
                        Aah!

                        HAWK
                       Gotcha.

                        MUNCH
           Aah! (Gasps) Oh my gosh. Help!

                       JUNIOR
              Hey did you hear that?

                      FLUTTER
                        No.

                       MUNCH
                       Help!

                       JUNIOR
              Well did you hear that?

                      FLUTTER
       No. I did not hear that cry for help.

The hawk swoops down low, flying right overhead.

                         MUNCH
                       Hel-lo!

                       JUNIOR
           Okay, tell me you heard that.

                      FLUTTER
                      Uh, no?

                        MUNCH
                    Help!...Help!

                        JUNIOR
 Well go on, go on! you're the one with the wings!
                          FLUTTER
     Fine, I'm going already. You're worse than my
                        mother.

Flutter flits up into the sky and approaches the hawk
with hesitation.

                        MUNCH
                   It's about time!

                         FLUTTER
               Hey, what you got there?

                         HAWK
                        Lunch.

                        FLUTTER
            You gonna eat that? Grrrross.

                         MUNCH
                     I'm not food!

                        FLUTTER
        Okay, you asked for it...Robin attack!

 Flutter and the hawk begin an epic chase through the
 trees.

                          MUNCH
     Get your big claws off of me! Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!

 Tiny Flutter bonks the hawk on the head repeatedly.

                          HAWK
                   Back off, bon bon.
                        FLUTTER
              Drop it! Drop the mouse!

                        MUNCH
      Yeah!...No. No dropping! No dropping! No
            droooooooooooooooooo-.......

                       FLUTTER
                    Incomiiiing!

                       MUNCH
                  aaaAAHHHH...oof!

A quick-thinking Junior catches Munch.

                         JUNIOR
                        Gotcha!

                        FLUTTER
                    Look ooouuuut!

                       JUNIOR
                    Not again.

          FLUTTER & JUNIOR (simultaneous)
                       Oof!

                       FLUTTER
         Hey, thanks for breaking my fall.

                         JUNIOR
                 Don't... mention it.

They both look over to Munch, who is laying on the
ground, eyes closed. Is she dead?
                         MUNCH
                     ...He gone?

                        JUNIOR
                         Yeah.

                       MUNCH
  Nice catch. where'd you get your pilot's license,
                off a birdseed box?

                       FLUTTER
                  You're welcome.

                        JUNIOR
                Let's go, flutter.

                        MUNCH
               Hey, you guys hungry?

                       JUNIOR
  Sorry. We have an appointment with the clock of
                        Fall.

                       FLUTTER
  Actually I do need to eat regular periodic small
                       meals.

                        MUNCH
  Come on. I know where we can get something good!

Munch leads them to a tree with juicy apples. Flutter
flies up, tries, and fails to pull one off the tree.

                        JUNIOR
                     Okay, plan B.

In an epic montage, Junior brilliantly combines a
board, fulcrum, and rock, making him the inventor of
simple machines. He jumps on the board, launching
the rock. It hits the apple but bounces off, hitting
Junior in the face, likely giving him lifelong brain
damage.

                        JUNIOR
           Figures. My ideas never work.

Magically, the apple falls on its own and rolls over
to Munch, who takes a satisfied bite.

                       MUNCH
          Aaaah. So! Where we off to now?

Cut to a dark and stormy Summer Hill. Antoine the
french caterpillar has come upon the clock, and
underneath it, a burst open watermelon.

                          ANTOINE
  Zere was a struggle here...[sniffs] there were three
penguins...in prosthetic ears!and one slightly mangy
    bunny... [sniffs] a gopher...no! a chipmunk! was
 imprisoned...in a papaya...no no! a watermelon... I
        love watermelon! my quest...continues!

Cut back to our newly formed trio, who are journeying
through the forest of Fall Falls.

                         MUNCH
  I told you, all I needed was a little pick-me-up!
           Hurry up, we're almost there!

The clock comes into view. Four penguins and a bat are
teetering in front of it, stacked high in order to
reach the clock face and remove the leaf of Fall.

                       JUNIOR
                   (girly gasp)

Junior whips his head around to see Irontail and
Jackie Frost standing to one side, watching as their
minions do their bidding.

                       JUNIOR
    Those are the guys I was tellin' ya about!


                       FLUTTER
                     Get down!

                       MUNCH
                  Let me at `em!

                       JUNIOR
  Get down! Guys, we're only gonna get one shot at
                       this.

                       MUNCH
                  You got a plan?

                      JUNIOR
                 Do I got a plan!

                      IRONTAIL
  The spring of Spring, the sun of Summer, and the
leaf of Fall. You know what this means? The seasons
   have stopped changing, and all that remains is
                      winter.

                       JACKIE
Yes but, don't you think that you should let me take
           care of those little baubles?

                      IRONTAIL
 Ease up, Jackie my dear. Stop being such a control
                       freak.

                       JACKIE
                Don't call me that.

                      IRONTAIL
                   Control freak?

                       JACKIE
                  No, "my dear."

Suddenly a dozen pinecones are launched into the
sky, falling around Jackie and Irontail.

                       JACKIE
                 Who is doing that?

                       JUNIOR
              That WHO...would be me!

                      IRONTAIL
                   Cottontail...
 Temporarily distracted by a pinecone to the face,
Irontail drops the clock parts. Flutter and Munch
swoop in and grab them.

                       IRONTAIL
                        Ow! Ow!

                         JACKIE
                      After them!

Another epic chase montage. Flutter and Munch manage
to evade Jackie's ice rays and bring the items back to
their leader.

                       FLUTTER
                   Here, Junior!

                        MUNCH
                     We did it!

                      IRONTAIL
                 Hand em over, kid.

                       JUNIOR
  Never! Never in a million years! Never in-- hey!

                       IRONTAIL
 Just like your father. Say hi to him for me. (make
                  metal tail noise)

Irontail removes the fake fluff from his butt
revealing his iron tail, shaking it around all
sassy.

                       JUNIOR
                      Iron Tail!

                        JACKIE
   Oh and kids? If I were you, I'd bundle up. It's
going to be a very, very cold LIFE! AAHAHAaahahaaaa!

                        JUNIOR
            Look, face it, we're toast.

                       MUNCH
                Hmm, toast? Where?!

                       JUNIOR
Will you stop thinking about food?! We blew it. It's
                        over.

                         MUNCH
  Well if your stupid invention worked like it was
                   supposed to...

                      FLUTTER
Well if you didn't have to eat your own weight every
                  ten minutes...

                       MUNCH
       Maybe if you weren't such a chicken.

                      FLUTTER
          I'm not a chicken. I'm a robin.

                        JUNIOR
  Here's an idea, why don't both of you just face
 facts? Ever since we met, absolutely nothing has
gone right. Your baby brother is never gonna hatch.
 Your family is never gonna have anything to eat, and
        I'll never be able to go home again.

                      FLUTTER
                    Uh, Junior?

                       MUNCH
                   Where are we?

                         SSS
 Our heroes found themselves in a magical, colorful
place, Color Land! Where every color of the rainbow
   comes from....And soon they came upon the soul
 resident of Color Land, Seymour S. Sassafras! They
        should be arriving... right about now.

                       JUNIOR
                   Who should?

                        SSS
                    You should!

                      JUNIOR
                   Should what?

                        SSS
Be arriving! And you're about to ask for my help.

                       JUNIOR
            And...do you give it to me?

                        SSS
I...I-I can't remember...Oh! Yes, yes I do. Follow
 me. And so they walked across the bridge. And Mr.
  Sassafras told him that Jackie and Irontail's plan
   was to plunge the world into permanent winter.

                         ALL
                       (gasp)

                        SSS
  Don't worry! ...Sassafras's incredible bustproof
   bubble never bobbles! At least it hasn't yet!

Mr. Sassafras leads them to a wacky-looking
contraption that looks like a giant bubble attached
to an air pump.

                       JUNIOR
 This is all my fault. Why do I spend so much time
             dreaming about tomorrow?

                         SSS
It's important to dream about tomorrow, Junior, but
   you have to take care of today. It's a classic
               today-tomorrow problem.

They climb into the giant bubble and it begins to
rise.

                       JUNIOR
Bye, Mister Sassafras! Oh, by the way, how do we get
                       down?

                        SSS
       Not a problem! Just pull the rip cord!

                      FLUTTER
              Ah, first-class travel!
 MUSIC BREAK: MAKE IT APPEAR

We cut to Antoine, who is struggling through a
blustery Fall Falls.

                       ANTOINE
 I am persisting in my quest. At this rate I will
never find the junior! Time...is my enemy. AAAhh! I
                 meant to do that!

Meanwhile, in the sky bubble, our heroes are fast
asleep.

                       WIND
             [Sinister roaring noises]

                       FLUTTER
                   What was that?

                       JUNIOR
                   I don't know!

                        WIND
                    Rrroooaarrr!

                      FLUTTER
 Ok...ok...ok! Let's do somethin'! Like get out of
                       here?

                        JUNIOR
    Maybe if we raise the average kinetic energy
      quotient to offset the external inertia!

                       MUNCH
                 What does that mean?

                       JUNIOR
    It means we gotta get out of here! Come on!

They throw themselves at the bubble's interior walls
frantically, to no avail.

                       FLUTTER
          Nobody tell my mama I did that.

                        WIND
                     Rrroooaaarr!

                          ALL
                       Aaahhhh!

                         WIND
 Gotcha! Ha ha ah ahaha ah! Got you good! You should
       see the looks on your faces! Hahahahaa!


                       JUNIOR
What is the matter with you? That's no way to treat
                      people!

                        FLUTTER
        Didn't your mama teach you manners?

                       MUNCH
              We're starving in here!

                       JUNIOR
   And we have to get to Winter Ridge as soon as
                     possible!
                        WIND
               Sorry, sirs, ma'am.

                       MUNCH
      Hey, maybe he could help us get there.

                       WIND
  Hmm, Winter Ridge? Okay now uh, that's quite a
                    distance.

                      FLUTTER
Yeah, but for the north wind, one big huff could do
                     it right?

                        WIND
Ha ha ha ha ha! The North wind! Hahaha! The North
wind? Is that what I look like to you? Hahahaha!

                       JUNIOR
        Uhh I'm sorry, the Western wind?

                        WIND
Ahahahahah! I guess I can't expect a bunny to know.
Heh heh heh heh. Thanks for the compliment. No, I'm
not one of these big "celebrity winds." Ga ha ha ha
                      ha ha...

                       JUNIOR
            But you are a wind, right?

                      WIND
Oh yeah, sure! Have you ever heard of the East by
  Southwest wind? Well, you're looking at him.

                      MUNCH
     Oh, great. Stuck in midair with the East by
                  Southwest wind.

                      WIND
Let's not get personal now. I could send you back
                 the other way.

                        JUNIOR
No! She's sorry Mr. Wind, sir. She gets crabby when
                   she's hungry.

                       WIND
                Really? Same here!

                       JUNIOR
     It's just we really need whatever help--

                        WIND
(interrupting) It's ok, it's ok, listen. I can tell
 you're good people. I'll do whatever it is I can.
                       Mmmm?

                       JUNIOR
       Great! Thank you so much, Mister...

                       WIND
Just call me Wind! Get ready now! (warmup blowing
                     noises)

                      FLUTTER
  This guy couldn't blow out a birthday candle!

                        WIND
 Just getting warmed up, just getting warmed up.
      Lemme try again. (more crazy noises)
                          MUNCH
  I should have brought along some buffalo wings.

                      FLUTTER
                       What?!

                        WIND
Hang on, hang on! I almost caught it that time. (big
                  inhale, big blow)

                         ALL
           Yeah! Woohoo! You did it! Etc.

                        WIND
               Thank you, thank you.

                        SSS
 While our heroes tried and tried to get themselves
to Jackie Frost's fortress, April Valley looked more
               like February Valley.

                         WIND
      (blowing, blowing, running out of steam...)

                         MUNCH
                    We're here!

                        WIND
     Whew. We are? Thank goodness, I'm a little
                 lightheaded. Whoa.

                        JUNIOR
You were awesome! I mean not quite gale-force, but--
                       FLUTTER
           Definitely kite-flying wind!

                        WIND
         Why thank you, gosh, that's nice.

                       JUNIOR
 Now if you could just put us down someplace safe...?

                        WIND
   Down? Mmm, I don't do down. I'm a wind, not a
       downspout. Want me to call my cousin?

                       FLUTTER
 Mr. Sassafras said if we ever needed to get down,
               just pull the ripcord!

                       JUNIOR
   (grunting noises as he jumps up to pull cord)

Junior pulls the cord, creating a hole in the top of
the bubble. They begin to plummet.

                        ALL
                  Aaaaaaaaaaaaahh!

                       FLUTTER
             Assume crash positiooooon!

                        ALL
  [landing painfully] D'oh! Ooh! Ow! Etc....Yeah!

They land on some ice...which immediately breaks off
and begins to sink.
                          MUNCH
          You know, it's always something.

                       WIND
                  Yeeeeeeeeeehaw!

                       JUNIOR
                       Look!

                        WIND
                  [blowing noises]

                         ALL
                 Yeah! Woohoo! Etc.

                      JUNIOR
                 Bye! And thanks!

                        WIND
Anytime. Look me up next time you blow through town!

The gang begins to trudge up towards the frozen
palace, sneaking past some dumbass penguin guards.
Inside, Munch slips on some ice, narrowly escaping
death once again.

                         MUNCH
                      AAAhhhhhh!

                       FLUTTER
                    Grab my wing!

Inside the throne room, Jackie is fitting Irontail for
a royal robe.
                       IRONTAIL
 [sinister chuckle] by morning April Valley will be
frozen solid, and never again will I have to endure
   the springing of Spring, the rising of sun, or
             the...bringing of bonnets.

                       JACKIE
                Hold still, I say!

Junior, Flutter, and Munch sneak in silently, and
notice the trinkets frozen in a huge block of ice.

                       JACKIE
 That about does it. How's it feeling in the arms?

                      IRONTAIL
               Roomy. A perfect fit.

                       JACKIE
This will keep you warm in the winter wasteland, now
               known as everywhere!

                       JUNIOR
        Munch, do you like eating ice cream?

                       MUNCH
                 I love ice cream!

                        JUNIOR
               Well you're in luck.

                      IRONTAIL
             Speaking of perfect fits...

                       JACKIE
    ...What? Why are you looking at me like that?

                       MUNCH
    I see the ice but when do I get the cream?

                      JUNIOR
             Just a little bit longer!

                      IRONTAIL
  We make a charming couple, you and I. the whole
            world is our frozen oyster

                       JACKIE
         And finally I get to rule it all!

                      IRONTAIL
                        You?

                       JACKIE
       Well you didn't think you'd rule it?

                      IRONTAIL
 Oh I think you're forgetting whose idea this whole
                    scheme was.

                       JACKIE
              Yes, but we took my car!

                       IRONTAIL
Good point, got me there. How about a power-sharing
                   arrangement?

The two shake hands. Meanwhile in the corner of the
room, Munch has licked the leaf of Fall free from the
 ice. Suddenly, they're spotted by Montresor the bat,
who tugs on Irontail's sleeve.

                      IRONTAIL
                    Cottontail!

In this short amount of time, Munch has miraculously
licked all the way to the center of the ice block,
freeing the spring and the other thingies. Epic
penguin battle ensues.

                       JACKIE
                     Get them!

                       JUNIOR
           Go wide! Flutter, over here!

Flutter does a sick hockey puck boomerang move with
the sun of Summer, knocking down the ice chandelier
on top of the villains. Then Irontail lifts the
chandelier off them with Edward Cullen-like
strength.

                       JUNIOR
             Quick, Come on! Let's go!

There is a chase scene through the ice tunnels.
JUNIOR, MUNCH, and FLUTTER emerge from the tunnel
and begin walking through a blizzard. Then IRONTAIL
and JACKIE emerge.

                       JUNIOR
        We gotta find our way out of here!

                      FLUTTER
                   We gotta hide!

                       MUNCH
  Or at least find a place to stash these things!

                      FLUTTER
                   I can't see!

                       MUNCH
                    Me neither!

                       JUNIOR
                      There!

They come upon a foreboding clock tower made of
ice.

                        MUNCH
                What is this place?

                       JUNIOR
         This must be the clock of Winter!

Suddenly, there is a voice from behind.

                      IRONTAIL
                What, no catapults?

Munch throws a tiny mouse-sized snowball at Jackie.

                       JACKIE
       Oh! How'd you guess, my favorite game!

Jackie traps them in a giant snowball with her epic
sexy snow powers.
                       IRONTAIL
          Irontail and Frost do it again!

                       JACKIE
        I think you mean Frost and Irontail

                        JUNIOR
            I've got an idea! stay here!


                         MUNCH
                          Duh.

Conveniently, they are still right in front of the
entrance to the clock tower. Junior effortlessly digs
through the giant snowball and finds himself inside
the clock of Winter. He spots the shiny thingy that
probably controls the seasons. Outside, things aren't
looking good for Flutter and Munch.

                       IRONTAIL
   I think it wise we disposed of these forever.

                       JACKIE
               [evilly] My pleasure...

Jackie is ready to straight up murder these animal
children.

                      IRONTAIL
             I meant these, not those.

Having been discouraged from committing infanticide,
Jackie contemplates the weather-controlling clock
thingies.
                         JACKIE
I know a place for these where they'll never be seen
   again. And lucky for us, it's right over here!

She means this giant convenient cliff-slash-abyss
they're standing next to. Back inside the clock,
Junior is being a genius.

                        JUNIOR
 The timing mechanism must be driven by the master
   governor in the upper pivot rod! Okay. Today,
          tomorrow, today, tomorrow, now!

He successfully grabs the crystal and exits the clock
tower.

                        JACKIE
             What is with this rabbit?

                      IRONTAIL
                  Must be genetic.

Now that junior has removed the last clock piece,
there are no more seasons at all. The ground begins to
shake.

                        JUNIOR
                        Uh oh.

Suddenly, the clock tower is surrounded in a
terrifying green vortex, which extends up into the sky
and spreads throughout the land. Cut to April Valley.

                        PETER
                         Huh??

                         ELROY
                        Oh my.

The same apocalyptic green sky and lightning storm is
happening in Summer Hill, and Fall Falls. Back at the
clock of Winter, Junior has a determined look on his
little bunny face.

                        JUNIOR
  Give us back those and I'll give you back this!

                      IRONTAIL
                       Nevah!

Just then, his tail gets struck by a bolt of
apocalypse lightning.

                      IRONTAIL
  Heruuugherughuuuaahghh!...I guess we're open to
                   negotiation.

                        JACKIE
Here's the deal, you give us back winter, we'll give
  you Fall. I don't mind watching things shrivel.

                       JUNIOR
 Not a chance! It's all or nothin, freeze dry! I'm
                   not kidding!

Junior dangles the crystal over the cliff's edge.

                      IRONTAIL
 Think you're pretty cute, eh, little tiny bunny? You
             drop yours, we drop ours.

                      FLUTTER
                  Where you goin?


                       MUNCH
   Goin' to get my munch on! Nom nom nom nom nom

                      IRONTAIL
    Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! (his tail makes noise)

                       JACKIE
              Stop that tail ringing!

                      IRONTAIL
                I can't! Ow! Ow ow!

                       JACKIE
             I said cut it out, Fluffy!

                      IRONTAIL
            Anything you want, my dear!

                       JACKIE
                Don't call me that!

Jackie attacks Irontail, and in the struggle, the
leaf and sun fall off the cliff!

                      IRONTAIL
          This is all your fault, my dear!

                       JACKIE
     Oh, Fluffy! Don't turn on me now, Fluffy!
 The two fight over the spring.

                      IRONTAIL
           I got it! I got it! I got it!

Jackie pounces again and they both fall off the cliff,
but all the important clock parts fall with them.

                       FLUTTER
        I can't believe I'm about to do this!

                         MUNCH
                       Flutter!

Flutter dives down into the abyss, and for a moment
disappears into the darkness.

                        JUNIOR
                    Oh, Flutter...

Is he dead? No, this is a children's movie. Flutter
appears behind them, heroically holding all the clock
pieces.

                        JUNIOR
                         Yeah!

                        MUNCH
                       Woohoo!

Junior restores the crystal to the clock of Winter.

                          ALL
                  Woohoo! Yeah! Etc.
                         MUNCH
  That was awesome! We should do this more often.

                       FLUTTER
            Don't EVEN joke about that.

                       JUNIOR
        But how are we gonna get back home?

                       MUNCH
       I am NOT getting back in that bubble.

                       WIND
                    Yeeeeeeehaww!

                        ANTOINE
            Did somebody call a taxicab?

The gang climbs on top of mister Wind, and they set
off towards Fall Falls to start making things
right.

                        WIND
               Everybody comfortable?


                         ALL
                 Yeah! Woohoo! Etc.

                         WIND
                     Let's blow!

Munch returns to Fall Falls, restores the clock, says
goodbye to her new friends, and reunites with her
loving parents.
                         MUNCH
                    See you guys!

                        JUNIOR
                    See ya, Munch!

                       FLUTTER
                       See ya!

                      MAMA MOUSE
          Oh, we were so worried about you!

                      PAPA MOUSE
                Welcome home, honey.

Next stop is Summer Hill, where Flutter restores
Summer.

                       CHIPMUNK
                   Thanks, Flutter!

                        JUNIOR
                     Bye Flutter!

                       FLUTTER
            Thanks, I had fun! Bye y'all!

                      MAMA ROBIN
   Welcome home baby! Ooh, your mama missed you!

Suddenly, a crack in the egg. Then a chirp!

                      FLUTTER
                  Little brother!

Finally, Junior returns home to April Valley.
                          JUNIOR
     Thanks for everything, wind. Catch you later!

                         WIND
                         Bye!

He restores the spring of Spring and the clock begins
working again. In the town center, all are gathered.

                        ANTOINE
 Let me through, let me through! Peter, to you I have
  made a promise. And today I have kept that promise!
               I give to you, your son!

                         JUNIOR

                         PETER
                        Junior!

                    MRS. COTTONTAIL
             We were so worried about you.

                         ANTOINE
     (sniffs) Sadly, Antoine has... no one to hug!

 Junior and his mom hug Antoine the hero. Suddenly,
 there comes a deep voice from the crowd.

                       IRONTAIL
                 what a tender scene!

                         JACKIE
            I'd like to freeze it forever!
                          PETER
   Irontail...! Stay here. Let me take care of this.

 Peter advances towards Jackie's onslaught of ice
 rays, using the calendar as a shield. One of the
 pages rips off.

                          PETER
           Hey, look everyone! April's here!

                         JACKIE
               (shooting magic ice rays)

                         PETER
                [grunting in reaction]

                       IRONTAIL
                   Ice him, Jackie!

                        JUNIOR
               Hold on Dad, I'm coming!

                        ANTOINE
                        Junior!

Junior heroically jumps in front of his father,
deflecting Jackie's ice ray with the shiny key. The
ice magic ricochets and freezes Jackie instead!

                         IRONTAIL
  Looks like you won another one, Cottontail. I don't
 mean to turn tail and run, but it's time to put this
                    battle on ice.

                         JACKIE
     Excuse me! Aren't you forgetting something?

                       IRONTAIL
                So sorry, my dear.

                       JACKIE
               I'm sorry too, Fluffy!

Jackie shoots a freeze ray at Irontail, who becomes
a big ice cube and comically falls into the pink
lemonade river. The crowd cheers!

                    MRS. COTTONTAIL
 Oh Junior, you're just like your father. Isn't he,
                       Peter?

                        PETER
I think he's his own man now. Aren't you, Junior? I
                   mean, Peter.

                       JUNIOR
                      Aw, Dad!

                        PETER
  You know son, I've had a little trouble with the
nougat machinery. I could really use a guy with some
           new ideas. If ya know anybody.

                       JUNIOR
 First, for temperature control purposes, I propose
adding a bank of digital thermometers to the nougat
                        vat...

                         SSS
    And that's the story of the bee who saved arbor
 day-- I mean the bunny who saved Spring. Yes, yes!
That's a much better story. Nobody likes bees, they
  just sting people and interrupt them, but that's
        just my opinion, Seymour S. Sassafras.
